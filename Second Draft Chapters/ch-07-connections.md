# Chapter 7: Connections

## Baltimore, 1994

---

The coffee was the color of river silt and tasted approximately the same. Thomas Reed drank it anyway, standing in the hallway outside Courtroom 4B with his briefcase wedged between his ankles and his tie loosened to the second button. He'd been up since four-thirty, mouthing his closing argument to the window of his studio apartment while the radiator clanked beneath it like a metronome with a grudge. Now it was eight-forty, and the fluorescent light above him flickered every nine seconds -- just enough to notice, not enough to justify a maintenance call.

He was twenty-four years old. He had been a public defender for eleven months.

Thomas opened his briefcase and pulled out the manila folder for the third time that morning. Jerome Carter. Case number 94-CR-2847. He didn't need to read it again. He'd memorized it weeks ago, the way he used to memorize Bible verses in his mother's kitchen -- through sheer repetition until the words became reflex, until the facts were load-bearing walls inside his head and the argument was a structure he could walk through with his eyes closed.

Jerome was seventeen. He'd been the lookout during a corner-store robbery on North Avenue last October, standing outside with his hands in his jacket pockets while two older guys went inside with a pistol and took six hundred dollars from the register. The gun wasn't Jerome's. The plan wasn't Jerome's. Jerome had been there because Daryl Simms was his cousin's boyfriend and because saying no to Daryl Simms was not something people in that neighborhood did casually. The store owner, Mr. Park, had not been hurt. The six hundred dollars had been recovered.

The prosecution wanted to try Jerome as an adult. Conspiracy. Armed robbery. The full weight of a system designed for men twice his age brought down on a boy who had stood on a sidewalk.

Thomas wanted juvenile court. Probation. Community service. A future.

He'd built his case the way his torts professor had taught him: brick by brick, each fact a surface the judge could stand on. Jerome had no priors. His guidance counselor at Douglass High had written a letter calling him "quiet, cooperative, and unlikely to be a discipline problem." It was the kind of letter that said almost nothing, which meant the kid had been invisible at school -- not troubled enough to flag, not exceptional enough to notice. Thomas had gone to Douglass himself and talked to the counselor, a woman named Mrs. Baines who covered three schools and had a caseload of four hundred students. She remembered Jerome's face but not his name until Thomas reminded her. That was the system. That was what invisible looked like from the inside.

Thomas thought about that word. *Invisible.* He'd been invisible once. Middle school, before his mother had sat him down at the kitchen table and said, *Thomas, the world is not going to hand you anything. You speak up or you disappear.* She'd said it the way she said everything -- plainly, without apology, the way you state the weather or the price of milk. He'd chosen to speak up. Jerome hadn't had the same instruction manual.

A clerk leaned out from down the hall. "Courtroom 4B, docket's moving. Reed? You're third."

Thomas straightened his tie. It was maroon, a graduation gift from his aunt Dorothy, who believed that a Black man in a courtroom needed to look like he'd been there before. Even if he hadn't.

---

He had three minutes for closing. Judge Halliday was generous with some things but not with time. Thomas stood, buttoned his jacket, and looked at Jerome.

The kid was seated at the defense table in a white shirt his mother had ironed that morning, the creases sharp enough to see from across the room. Jerome's hands were flat on the table. He was staring at them the way you stare at something when you're trying not to look at anything else -- not the judge, not the prosecutor, not the flag behind the bench that represented a country currently deciding whether to throw him away.

"Your Honor," Thomas said, and his voice came out steady, which was not always the case. "The prosecution has asked this court to treat Jerome Carter as an adult. To sentence him as though he held the gun, planned the robbery, and chose violence. But the facts tell a different story."

He paused. Not for drama. Because Judge Halliday was writing something, and you didn't talk while Halliday wrote. Thomas had watched three other defenders make that mistake. Each one had gotten exactly the expression a person gets when they realize they've been speaking into a phone that disconnected thirty seconds ago.

"Jerome Carter was a lookout. He stood on a sidewalk. He did not enter the store. He did not handle the weapon. He did not know the weapon existed until after the fact. He was seventeen years old, in the company of a twenty-six-year-old man with a history of violent offenses -- a man who is currently serving time in this jurisdiction while Jerome Carter sits here in a shirt his mother ironed at five this morning."

ADA Blount, the assistant district attorney, watched from the prosecution's table with the expression of someone filling out tax returns. She wasn't cruel. She was processing volume. Thomas understood that Jerome Carter was a file number to her, not a face. That was the machinery. That was what he was pushing against.

"The question before this court isn't whether Jerome Carter made a mistake. He did. He knows that." Thomas looked at Jerome. Jerome's jaw was tight. His eyes were wet. "But the question is whether a seventeen-year-old boy who stood on a sidewalk should have his entire life defined by the worst decision of his adolescence. Whether we're going to tell this kid that the system exists to punish him or that it exists to give him a chance to become someone better than the worst thing he ever did."

He could feel his heart in his throat. He made himself slow down.

"We are asking this court not for leniency but for proportionality. For a chance at rehabilitation, which is what the juvenile justice system was designed to provide. We are asking you to look at Jerome Carter and see what I see -- a seventeen-year-old kid who made a mistake, who has a mother in this courtroom, who has a future that this court has the power to protect."

He sat down. His hands were damp. He pressed them flat against his thighs under the table, where no one could see.

Halliday took off his glasses and cleaned them with a cloth from his breast pocket -- a ritual Thomas had seen enough times to know it meant the judge was thinking, genuinely thinking, not performing thought. Jerome's mother, Denise, sat in the front row with her purse in her lap and her mouth set in a line that Thomas recognized: the face of a woman holding herself together by the force of her will, the way a dam holds water, not by wanting to but by having no choice.

"Mr. Reed," Halliday said, putting his glasses back on. "I'm inclined to agree with your assessment. The juvenile system exists for cases precisely like this one."

The terms came: reduced charge, juvenile adjudication, eighteen months of probation, two hundred hours of community service, enrollment in the mentorship program through Morrell Community Center. If Jerome completed the terms, the record would be sealed.

Thomas wrote it all down. His pen was shaking. His notes would later prove difficult to read. Beside him, Jerome let out a breath that sounded like it had been held for months.

---

Outside, the October air was sharp enough to feel like a correction after the staleness of the building. Thomas stood on the courthouse steps and watched Jerome and his mother walk toward the parking lot.

Denise had her arm around her son's shoulders. She was talking rapidly, the words inaudible at this distance but the cadence unmistakable -- gratitude and warning braided together, *thank God* and *don't you ever* woven into a single stream. Thomas had grown up around women who talked like that. His mother. His aunt Dorothy. The women at Greater Hope Baptist who could praise the Lord and issue a threat in the same sentence without pausing for breath.

Jerome looked back once. He didn't wave. He was seventeen and had just been told he might still have a life, and the enormity of that was visible in his posture -- the way his shoulders were up near his ears, the way he walked close to his mother, not cool, not detached, just a kid whose relief was too big for his body.

Thomas gave him a small nod. Jerome turned and got into his mother's car -- a Buick, late eighties, rust on the quarter panels. It turned east toward North Avenue and disappeared.

Thomas sat on the courthouse steps and let himself feel it.

Most of his cases ended in plea bargains that felt like organized surrenders. He'd spent eleven months watching the system process people the way a mill processes grain: efficiently, indifferently, reducing individual human beings to their constituent charges and sentencing guidelines. But today the system had bent toward something that looked like justice, and Thomas had been the one who bent it.

He closed his eyes and tipped his head back. October in Baltimore: cool air, warm light, the sky scrubbed blue above the stone facade of the courthouse. He thought about calling his mother but decided to wait until evening, when he could tell the story with all the beats in the right order. She'd want details. She always wanted details. *What did the judge say? What were you wearing? Did you eat breakfast?* The first question would be about breakfast. It was always about breakfast.

He was good at this. He was good at this and it mattered and the world was open and he was twenty-four years old. He sat on the steps and felt the sun on his face and did not know that this was the best he would ever be.

---

The Morrell Community Center sat on the corner of Eutaw and Mosher, a converted rowhouse with a hand-painted sign and a basketball court out back that was two inches short on both sides. Whoever had painted the three-point line had used a string and a can of white paint and gotten close enough. The court was always full. You could hear the thump of the ball from a block away, and the chain net on the hoop made a sound like a zipper when the ball went through clean.

Tonight the center smelled like floor cleaner and sheet cake. Someone had taped balloons to folding tables with masking tape. A hand-drawn banner read: MORRELL FALL CELEBRATION. The handwriting was a child's -- large, uneven, the letters going uphill.

Thomas hadn't planned to come. But the center's director, Dwight Morris, had called that afternoon and said, *You should be here tonight, counselor. People want to thank you.* The invitation had the weight of a summons. Dwight was a big man with a preacher's voice and a community organizer's instinct for making you feel like you'd volunteered for something you hadn't been asked to do.

Thomas got a paper plate of food -- baked chicken, greens, cornbread, a square of sheet cake that was mostly frosting -- and stood near the wall, eating and watching the room the way he watched courtrooms: looking for the structure underneath the noise. Who deferred to whom. Who talked with their hands. Who stood alone and who moved in clusters. He'd learned this from his mother, who could walk into any room and tell you within five minutes who ran it, who wanted to, and who had given up trying.

That was when he saw her.

She was standing by the punch bowl, talking to Dwight's wife, Linda, and she was laughing at something -- not a polite laugh but a real one, her head tipping back, the sound carrying across the room. She had braids pulled back from her face and the posture of someone who was listening carefully even while laughing, leaning slightly forward, making the other person feel like the most important person in a room full of people. She wore a blue blouse and earrings that caught the overhead light, and Thomas forgot about his cornbread.

He finished his food. He talked to Dwight about Jerome's community service schedule -- Jerome would start next week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, the after-school program. He shook hands with a woman named Mrs. Palmer who thanked him for a housing issue he'd helped with months ago, and then with Mrs. Palmer's neighbor, who thanked him for helping Mrs. Palmer, which was not the same thing but which he accepted because gratitude migrated through neighborhood networks like weather, touching everything nearby.

Then she was next to him.

"You're the lawyer," she said. It wasn't a question.

"Public defender. Thomas Reed."

"I know." She extended her hand. Her grip was firm and brief. "Michelle Warren. Social services, Pennsylvania Avenue office. Dwight told me you're the one who kept the Carter boy out of adult court."

"That's the goal. Keep kids in the system that's supposed to help them."

"It's a good goal." She picked up a cup of punch. "Most of the lawyers I work with have stopped having goals. They have caseloads and they have happy hours. The goals fell off somewhere in between."

"Public defenders don't have happy hours. We have leftover coffee and regret."

She smiled. It changed her whole face. "And how's your caseload?"

"Terrible," he said, and she laughed again, and the sound narrowed the room to a circle around the two of them, the balloons and the folding tables and the basketball court sounds from outside receding until the world was just this: a man and a woman standing by a table, talking the way people talk when they have recognized something in each other that neither has named yet.

They talked for an hour. She told him about her job -- intake caseworker, mostly families, the bureaucratic trench warfare of getting people into shelters and programs that were always full, always underfunded, always one budget cut from disappearing. She had a degree from Coppin State and the particular kind of patience that came from filling out the same forms for the same impossible situations and believing that the forms still mattered. She told him about a family she'd placed last week -- mother, three kids, a shelter in Pigtown that had one opening because someone else's funding had run out.

"That's how it works," she said. "Someone else's crisis has to end before yours can begin. Musical chairs, except the chairs are beds and there are never enough."

He told her about the scholarship that got him through law school and the loans that would keep him paying for ten years. He told her about his mother at the post office, thirty-one years, who believed that education was the only door nobody could lock behind you. He told her about Jerome -- not the case details, which were confidential, but the feeling. The feeling of standing up in a courtroom and saying *this kid matters* and having the judge agree.

"You really believe in this," she said. Not a question. An observation, the way a doctor observes a symptom -- clinical and curious at the same time. "In the system. That it can work."

"I believe it can work when people care enough to make it work. Today I watched it work. A judge looked at a seventeen-year-old kid and saw a kid, not a case number. That's not the system working. That's a person inside the system deciding to be decent."

"And tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow I've got three arraignments and none of them will go this well." He shrugged. "But that's tomorrow."

She looked at him. Her expression held something he couldn't read -- professional assessment and something warmer, the two things occupying the same features the way sunlight and shadow occupy the same wall.

"You're an optimist," she said.

"That a bad thing?"

"Not yet."

He asked for her number before he left. She wrote it on a napkin, each digit distinct, the handwriting of someone who filled out government forms all day and had learned that legibility was not optional. He folded the napkin and put it in his breast pocket, next to the pen he'd used in court that morning. The napkin sat against his chest and he could feel it there, a small square of weight, warm from his body.

Walking to his car, the October air cool on his face, the sound of the basketball court fading behind him, Thomas thought: *This is what a good day feels like.* He wanted to remember it. He wanted to mark it somehow, the way his mother marked good days by cooking something special -- pound cake, or the sweet potato pie she made on days when something worked out. He'd call her tonight. He'd tell her about Jerome and about Michelle Warren, and his mother would ask what Michelle did for a living and whether she went to church and what she was wearing, and Thomas would answer every question because his mother's questions were not interrogation. They were love in its most practical form.

---

The office on St. Paul Street was empty when Thomas got back -- five desks, a copier that broke every other week, case files stacked on every horizontal surface like geological strata. The fluorescent lights buzzed their one-note song. He'd come back to drop off his briefcase and finish a motion due Friday, but when he walked in, Robert Halloway was sitting in Thomas's chair.

Halloway was the senior attorney, if a public defender's office could be said to have seniority. Fifty-eight. Gray-haired. Wire-rimmed glasses that he peered over rather than through, giving every conversation the feeling of being examined from a slight height. He had the weary competence of a man who'd spent thirty years fighting cases he usually lost and had somehow avoided becoming bitter about it, or at least had gotten good enough at hiding the bitterness that it looked like wisdom. He still came in on Saturdays to review briefs in red pen. He still remembered every client's name. Thomas admired him the way you admire a building that has survived weather -- not for its beauty but for its refusal to fall down.

"Heard about the Carter ruling," Halloway said. He was holding a Styrofoam cup of coffee, grimacing at it the way he grimaced at everything he consumed in this office, as if the coffee were a brief filed by the opposition. "Halliday gave you the full juvenile package?"

"Probation, community service, mentorship program. Record sealed on completion."

"Good work." Halloway set the cup down. "You didn't overplay it. You let the facts carry the argument. Most young lawyers want to give a speech. You gave the judge a path."

Thomas allowed himself a moment. Halloway did not give compliments the way other people gave compliments. He gave them the way a surgeon gives a diagnosis: precisely, without sentiment, because accuracy mattered more than the feeling it produced.

"Listen, Tom." Halloway leaned back. The chair protested. "You're good at this. You've got the instincts. You're going to win more cases than you lose, which in this office makes you an anomaly."

Thomas waited. There was a quality to Halloway's tone that suggested a conjunction was coming. A *but*. A *however*. The kind of pivot that sounded like mentorship but steered toward a lesson you hadn't asked for.

"But winning cases isn't enough." Halloway folded his hands on his stomach. "You know the difference between a public defender who wins cases and one who actually changes things?" He paused, the way Thomas himself had paused in the courtroom -- not for drama, but because what came next needed its own space. "Connections."

He held up a hand before Thomas could respond.

"I don't mean schmoozing. I don't mean golf games and cocktail parties and whatever the private-sector guys do with their billable hours. I mean relationships. The judges who take your calls. The prosecutors who'll negotiate in good faith because they know you're not going to waste their time. The politicians who fund the programs your clients need after sentencing -- the halfway houses, the job training, the treatment centers. That's the scaffolding, Thomas. Without it, you're winning cases in a vacuum."

Thomas nodded. It sounded like wisdom.

"You won today because the facts were good and your argument was sound and Halliday happens to be a decent human being. But not every judge is Halliday. Not every case has clean facts. You're going to walk into courtrooms where the law is against you and the facts are against you and the only thing standing between your client and a decade in Jessup is the relationship you've built with the DA -- whether she trusts you enough to pick up the phone. That's the work nobody teaches you in law school."

"Relationships."

"Connections." Halloway stood. He was taller than Thomas remembered -- or maybe it was just the way the fluorescent light caught his glasses, turning them into small white rectangles that hid his eyes. He clapped Thomas on the shoulder. The hand was heavy. "Good work on Jerome. But connections matter more than cases. Remember that."

He picked up his coffee cup and left. The office was quiet. The copier hummed. Outside, a bus went past on St. Paul Street, the brakes singing their hydraulic note.

Thomas sat at his desk and turned the phrase over. *Connections matter more than cases.* He wrote it in the margin of his legal pad, next to the doodle of a half-drawn star he'd been working on during a phone call that morning.

It made sense. Of course it made sense. You couldn't save anyone from inside a vacuum. The work was bigger than any single case. It was relational. It was structural. It was the difference between patching a roof and building a house.

He didn't hear the other thing in it. Not then. Not that Tuesday evening in October, with his legal pad in front of him and the evening light coming through the dirty window and the napkin with Michelle Warren's number warm against his chest. He didn't hear the door the phrase would open, years from now, to the room where relationships became transactions, where the scaffolding was rebuilt with favors and money and the slow, invisible trade of principle for access. Where *connection* stopped meaning the judge who took your call and started meaning the developer who wrote the check. Where the word itself didn't change -- just what it pointed at.

Maybe that was all Halloway meant. Career advice from an old man to a young one. Scaffolding. Relationships. The ordinary architecture of a life spent working inside a system.

But the words would survive the intention. They'd follow Thomas through the years, accruing new meaning each time the definition of *connection* shifted -- from colleague to contact, from contact to donor, from donor to co-conspirator -- until the word no longer meant what Halloway had said in this office on this Tuesday in October. Until Thomas Reed, fifty-four years old and sitting in a courtroom, would hear a federal prosecutor use the word *connections* in the context of a racketeering indictment and think of this night. This office. This moment when the seed was clean and the soil was soft and neither he nor the man who planted it had any idea what it would grow into.

But that was later. That was years of small decisions, each one defensible, each one moving the line an inch until the line was somewhere else entirely and the man standing on it couldn't remember where it had been.

Right now, the phrase was clean. Right now, Thomas Reed was twenty-four and the world made sense.

---

Thomas left his car at the office. The night was good -- the kind of October night that felt like an apology for what was coming, winter crouched somewhere just beyond the calendar. He walked south on St. Paul and turned west, his hands in his pockets, his breath visible in the air.

He passed the blocks he knew: the barbershop on North Avenue where Mr. Clifton had been cutting hair since 1971 and could tell you the history of the neighborhood through the haircuts he'd given. The corner store where Mrs. Kim kept a jar of penny candy on the counter for the kids who came in after school, and where the bulletproof partition between the register and the customers told a different story than the candy jar. The row houses with their marble steps, scrubbed white by grandmothers who had scrubbed them every Saturday since before Thomas was born and would keep scrubbing them until the city gave them a reason to stop.

He turned south on Calvert Street and passed the old courthouse -- not the federal courthouse where he'd argued today, but the circuit court, a larger building with stone columns and wide steps and the words JUSTICE IS THE CONSTANT AND PERPETUAL WISH TO RENDER EVERY MAN HIS DUE carved above the entrance. The letters were dark against the pale stone, lit from below by spotlights that made the building look like a monument. Which it was. A monument to the idea that justice was an institution, a building, a system of rules applied equally. Thomas glanced at it the way you glance at a building you've walked past a hundred times -- with the familiarity that erases seeing.

He did not know that he would stand in that building at fifty-four, hands cuffed in front of him, while a clerk read the charges and a photographer from the *Sun* snapped a picture that would run above the fold. He did not know that the steps he was walking past would be the steps he descended in an orange jumpsuit, flanked by federal marshals, while reporters shouted questions he would not answer. The building was just a building. The steps were just steps. The carved words were just words, and Thomas Reed walked past them in the dark and did not look up.

On a bench outside the courthouse, near the bus stop, an old woman sat with a shopping bag between her feet. She was small and still, her coat buttoned to the throat, her hands folded in her lap. Her hair was white and pulled back, and she was watching the street with the patience of someone who had been waiting for a long time and had learned not to mind. She could have been anyone. She could have been anyone's grandmother, sitting on a bench in the cooling air, watching the city do what cities do at night.

Thomas walked past her. He did not recognize her. She did not recognize him. There was no reason she should have -- he was twenty-four now, tall, in a white shirt and loosened tie, nothing about him that would connect to the six-year-old boy who had sat in her classroom eighteen years ago, learning to write his letters on lined paper while she moved between the desks with her reading glasses on a chain around her neck, correcting pencil grips and telling them that the letter *S* started at the top, not the bottom.

Rosa Chen watched him pass. She did not know his name. She had taught hundreds of children. Some of them had become lawyers and teachers and nurses and bus drivers, and some of them had become other things, and she remembered faces but not names, and his face was different now.

Thomas kept walking. The old woman on the bench grew small behind him. The night took her back.

Neither of them knew what the other had been, or would become, or how the threads of their lives had touched once, briefly, in a classroom that no longer existed, in a decade that felt as distant as another country. Neither of them knew that they were, for a moment, within ten feet of each other -- close enough to speak, close enough to touch -- and that the moment passed the way most moments pass: without notice, without weight, dissolving into the ordinary darkness of an October night in Baltimore.

---

Third floor, Charles Street. A building that had been beautiful in the forties and was now held together by paint and the landlord's reluctance to invest in anything he couldn't bill for. Thomas set his briefcase by the door, hung his jacket on the back of the kitchen chair, and stood in front of the bathroom mirror.

The face looking back at him was young. He knew this the way a fish knows water -- which is to say, not at all. He saw dark eyes, a clean jaw, the maroon tie loosened, the white shirt wrinkled from a long day. He saw a man who had gotten up at four-thirty and fought for a seventeen-year-old kid and won. A man who had met a woman whose laugh carried across a room full of people and landed on him like a hand on his shoulder. A man whose boss had told him the future was built on relationships, and who had heard this as encouragement, as mentorship, as the ordinary passing of wisdom from one generation to the next.

He liked what he saw.

He turned off the light, heated up leftover lo mein, ate it standing at the counter because the table was covered with case files and his mother would have scolded him for eating on his feet but his mother was across town and what she didn't know was between him and God. He set the alarm for five. The napkin with Michelle's number was still in his breast pocket. He'd call her tomorrow. He was learning that timing mattered -- in court and out of it.

He turned off the apartment lights and stood for a moment at the window. Baltimore at night: the amber wash of streetlights, a siren winding through the west side, the glow of row house windows where people were watching television or putting children to bed or sitting at kitchen tables working out which bills to pay this month and which to let slide. Somewhere out there, Jerome Carter was home, beginning the long work of earning back a future that Thomas had helped keep open. Somewhere, Michelle Warren was in her own apartment, and the thought of her was a warmth in Thomas's chest that had nothing to do with the radiator.

He went to bed. He slept well.

He did not dream about Jerome Carter at thirty -- the third arrest, the robbery that was his own this time, the fifteen-year sentence that no young public defender would show up to fight. He did not dream about the riot at Jessup, the locked corridor, the body count that included a name Thomas would not recognize because by then Jerome Carter was no longer a face to him but a line item in the early chapter of a career that had gone somewhere else entirely.

He did not dream about a boy named David Okonkwo, twelve years old in 1994, swimming in a public pool in this same city, who would one day stand in a courtroom that looked like the one Thomas had stood in today -- except the man behind the prosecution's table would be Thomas Reed, older now, his tie a different color, his arguments calibrated not to justice but to a conviction rate, and the sentence he would seek for David would be the maximum, because by then connections mattered more than cases and the case was just a number and the number was just proof that the system worked the way the people who funded Thomas's campaigns needed it to work.

He did not dream about this because it hadn't happened yet, and because the man who would do it did not yet exist. That man was still asleep in a studio apartment on Charles Street, and the seed that would become him was a phrase written in the margin of a legal pad, and the phrase was still clean, and the soil was still soft, and the night was quiet, and he slept.
