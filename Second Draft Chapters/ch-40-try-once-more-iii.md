# Chapter 40: Try Once More III

**February 2035 — St. Michael's Hospital, Queens, New York**

---

The man on the gurney had no pulse and no name, and the paramedics were already looking at Rebecca Morrison the way people look at a clock when they know the answer but want the machine to say it.

"Found unresponsive on a bench outside the 74th Street subway entrance," said the lead paramedic, a woman named Vargas whose voice carried the flat, factual cadence of someone who had been running codes on sidewalks since before Rebecca was born. "No ID, no wallet, no phone. Bystander started compressions approximately twelve minutes ago. We've been working him for nine. Epi times three. Shocked twice in the field — v-fib converted to asystole six minutes in. He's been flat since."

Rebecca pulled on gloves. The latex snapped against her wrists — a sound she had heard ten thousand times, a sound that still produced in her the same involuntary narrowing of attention, the world contracting to the gurney and the patient and the monitor and the work.

Three-fourteen in the morning. The fluorescents in the trauma bay hummed at the same frequency they had been humming for forty years, casting the same jaundiced light on the same linoleum, and the sameness was not comforting but structural, the way a stage is structural — a fixed surface on which different performances occur. Her mother had stood under these lights. Had pushed against a different chest. Had heard the same flat whine from the same category of machine. Rebecca did not think about this. She thought about the patient.

He was mid-forties. Thin — not the leanness of fitness but the erosion of deprivation, the body's reserves consumed from the inside out. His coat had been decent once and was now ruined, the fabric ground dark with dirt, one pocket torn, the zipper broken open to expose a flannel shirt that swallowed his frame. The paramedics had cut through the shirt to place electrode pads, and the chest beneath was pale and marked with the particular topography of a life lived without shelter — old scars, a rash along the sternum, ribs visible as individual ridges beneath the skin.

His eyes were open. Red-rimmed, the conjunctiva inflamed, the kind of eyes that looked like they had been crying for a very long time — not from emotion but from wind and cold and exposure, the body's mechanical response to surfaces that offered no protection. They were not seeing anything. They stared at the fluorescent ceiling with the fixed, vacant regard of a body whose occupant had left.

"Resume compressions," Rebecca said.

Carlos, the night nurse, took position. He was a large man with hands that moved with the metronome discipline of someone who had learned that chest compressions were not about force but about precision — rate, depth, recoil, consistency. The gurney rocked with each push. The monitor drew its flat green line across the screen.

Rebecca checked the clock. Twenty-one minutes since the bystander had found him. Nine since the paramedics had arrived. Asystole for six of those minutes — the heart not fibrillating, not disorganized, not making any argument at all for its own continuation. Flat. The electrical system had quit. There was no rhythm to reset. There was absence.

She ordered another round of epinephrine. She watched it go in. She watched the monitor. The line did not change.

"Charge to two hundred."

She knew the protocols. Asystole was not a shockable rhythm. You could not restart a signal that did not exist — you could only reset one that was there but chaotic. But the protocols allowed for the attempt in ambiguous presentations, and Rebecca was not yet willing to accept the flatline as the final word, because twenty-one minutes was twenty-one minutes and not twenty-two, and the difference between those numbers was the width of a decision she had not yet made.

"Charged."

"Clear."

The body jumped. The monitor scrawled artifact — the electrical noise of the shock obliterating all data for a long, held second — and then settled back to the flat line. Asystole. The heart had nothing to say.

"Resume compressions."

Carlos resumed. His gloved hands on the sternum, the steady rhythm, the gurney rocking. Rebecca watched the monitor and the clock and the patient's face, which told her nothing, which was the face of a man who could have been anyone — any age, any history, any collection of experiences and attachments and daily habits that constituted a life. The only identifying feature was his hands: calloused, not from work but from the surfaces of a world that offered no softness. The calluses of park benches and concrete and shelter cots and the hard edges of doorways slept in.

Someone's hands. Someone's particular existence.

"How long?" Janet asked. She was the charge nurse, a woman in her fifties who had been at St. Michael's for twenty-five years and who spoke with the authority of someone who had watched many young doctors learn the difference between persistence and futility. She was not being unkind. She was asking a real question.

"I know how long," Rebecca said.

She did not look up from the monitor. She was counting compressions the way her mother had counted compressions fifty years ago in a room three floors above this one — mechanically, steadily, with the belief that the counting itself was a form of refusal. The refusal to stop counting.

Janet and Carlos exchanged a look. Rebecca saw it. The lateral glance, the silent communication that happened below speech — the look that meant *it's time* and *he's gone* and *the young doctor doesn't know when to stop.* She had been trained to recognize that look by a woman who had been on the receiving end of it half a century ago and had ignored it.

"Epi, push another round. Charge to three-sixty."

"Doctor —" Janet began.

"One more round."

The defibrillator climbed toward three hundred and sixty joules. The whine filled the room — high, thin, a frequency that lived behind the eyes. The epinephrine went in. Carlos paused compressions.

"Clear."

The body jumped. The monitor: artifact, then flatline. Asystole.

Rebecca watched the screen for three seconds. Five. Seven. The line was flat and the room was quiet and Carlos's hands hovered above the chest and Janet stood with the chart and the clock read 3:27 and the man on the gurney was dead.

"Time," Rebecca said. "Time of death —"

She stopped.

---

Not because of a sound. Not because of a voice. Nothing that would survive a deposition or a morbidity review or the clinical language of a chart note. What happened was that she stopped, and in the space where the next word should have been — the word *three*, followed by *twenty-seven*, followed by the silence that falls in a room when the numbers have been spoken and the record has been made and the body on the gurney becomes a body and not a patient — in that space, something pressed against the inside of her chest. Not pain. Not instinct. Something without a name.

Her mother's voice, except it was not her mother's voice. It was the architecture of a sentence she had been hearing since she was thirteen years old — *try once more* — a phrase that had traveled from a whisper in 1985 to a phone call during a pandemic to a bedside in 2029 to the structure of Rebecca's own practice, where it lived not as advice but as load-bearing wall. Remove it and the rest collapsed.

"One more," she said.

Janet looked up from the chart. "Doctor?"

"One more round. Push epi. Charge to three-sixty."

Janet set down the pen. The gesture was deliberate, visible, the same gesture a different nurse had made in this hospital fifty years ago — the pen set down, the ending deferred, the record left incomplete. Carlos placed his hands on the sternum. The defibrillator began its climb.

There was a sound in the doorway.

Rebecca did not turn. She was watching the monitor, her attention locked on the flat green line with the total focus of a woman who had nothing left to justify what she was doing — no protocol, no evidence, no clinical reasoning that would survive peer review. She had only the inherited conviction that one more try was owed to the body on the gurney, not because the body had earned it but because the trying was the thing, and the trying did not require justification any more than breathing required justification.

But the sound registered. A voice. Quiet, cracked with age, spoken from the doorway of the trauma bay at three-twenty-eight in the morning by a woman who should not have been in the hospital at this hour and who was here because she was always here, because fifty years of practice had made the building an extension of her body, and the body came to the building the way a hand comes to a railing in the dark — by memory, by instinct, by the need to hold something solid.

"Try once more."

Sarah Morrison stood in the doorway. Seventy-eight years old. Emeritus, which meant retired, which meant she had stopped performing procedures and stopped running codes and stopped making the decisions that happened at three in the morning when the monitor was flat and the room was waiting. It did not mean she had stopped coming. She came on Saturdays. She came on weekday mornings. She came, sometimes, at three a.m., walking the halls in the soft-soled shoes she had worn for decades, checking on residents the way she had once checked on patients — not because they needed her but because the checking was the work, and the work was the structure, and the structure was the only thing she had ever built that did not require maintenance.

She had been walking the hall when the code was called. She had come to the doorway. She had watched her daughter work — the positioning of the hands, the cadence of the orders, the set of the jaw that was Rebecca's and was also Sarah's and was also, if you traced it back far enough, the set of the jaw of a nine-year-old girl kneeling on a kitchen floor in 1966, pressing her small hands against her father's chest, refusing to stop.

"Try once more," Sarah said. She said it the way she had said it a thousand times — to residents and students and colleagues and, once, to a thirteen-year-old girl on the phone during a pandemic, and now to the twenty-eight-year-old woman that girl had become. The words were smooth from fifty years of use, worn to their essential shape, three syllables that carried the weight of every time they had been spoken and every life they had touched and every failure they had not prevented, because the words were not a guarantee. They were a practice.

Rebecca heard them. She had already decided. The words arrived not as cause but as confirmation — the sound of a door she had already opened, heard from the other side.

"Epi's in."

"Charged."

"Clear."

She placed the paddles on the man's chest. She could feel the ribs through the paddles, the hard cage of bone, and she pressed the buttons and the body jumped and the monitor showed artifact.

The artifact cleared.

The line was not flat.

---

It was not a rhythm. Not yet. It was something prior to rhythm — a disturbance in the flatness, a single electrical event that traveled through the cardiac muscle and produced, at its terminus, a contraction so faint that it was visible only on the monitor, not palpable at the wrist. A twitch. The heart's equivalent of a hand reaching for a surface in the dark.

Then another. And a gap — long enough for the room to hold its breath — and then a third. Irregular, tentative, the electrical system of a heart that had been silent for twenty-three minutes remembering a sequence it had performed billions of times across a span of years that Rebecca could not guess and would not have believed.

"Sinus," Carlos said. His voice had changed. "Rate forty-two. Forty-four."

"Blood pressure," Rebecca said.

"Sixty-eight over thirty-eight. Coming up."

"Pulse ox?"

"Eighty-two. Rising."

The numbers climbed. Not fast — the cautious, incremental ascent of a body deciding, organ by organ, system by system, whether to resume the project of being alive. Heart rate fifty. Blood pressure seventy-four over forty-two. Oxygen saturation eighty-six. Each number a small declaration, a small reversal of the flatline's verdict.

Rebecca placed her stethoscope on the man's chest. She listened. The heart was there — unsteady, groping, but present, the way a voice is present when someone speaks from far away and you cannot make out the words but you know the voice is real. She moved the stethoscope. Breath sounds, bilateral. The lungs were participating.

"Twelve-lead. ABG. Portable chest. Continuous monitoring. Vitals every five minutes."

She pulled off her gloves. Her hands were shaking. She let them shake.

In the doorway, Sarah Morrison pressed her hand against the doorframe — a habit she had picked up from someone she could not remember, a gesture of grounding, of confirming the boundaries of the space — and she watched her daughter's hands tremble and she did not offer comfort, because the trembling was earned, and earned things should not be taken away.

---

Ithuriel woke at 6:47 a.m.

He woke the way a machine restarts after a power failure — not gradually but all at once, every system coming online simultaneously, the body reporting its status before the mind had finished assembling itself from the scattered components of unconsciousness. His eyes opened. The ceiling was white. The lights were fluorescent. A monitor beeped at his left. An IV line ran into his right arm. His chest ached with a deep, structural pain that was not injury but consequence — the bruised sternum, the cracked ribs, the tissue-level protest of a body that had been compressed and shocked and compressed again.

He was alive.

This was not the expected result.

He lay still and catalogued. He did this the way he did everything — methodically, starting with the immediate and expanding outward in concentric rings of observation. The bed: hospital-grade, adjustable, the sheets stiff with industrial laundering. The room: cardiac unit, single-occupancy, the window showing a gray February sky. The monitor: sinus rhythm, rate sixty-two, blood pressure one-ten over seventy, oxygen saturation ninety-seven. The body: functional. Damaged. His.

He had been testing a hypothesis. The hypothesis was simple, the kind of question that required no theoretical framework and no approval from any council or committee, only a willingness to follow the inquiry to its terminal point: Can angels die?

Not metaphysically. He was not interested in metaphysics. He was interested in mechanism. Nine hundred years of service had given him access to a body — a human form indistinguishable from any other human form, subject to the same physics, the same chemistry, the same biology. It ate. It slept. It aged, slowly. It could be cut and would bleed. But could it stop? Could the heart cease and the lungs empty and the brain go dark the way human hearts and lungs and brains went dark, permanently, irreversibly? Or was there a floor — a minimum below which the system would not let him fall, a safety net built into the architecture of angelic embodiment that would catch him regardless of his intentions?

He had come to St. Michael's to find out. Not because the hospital was significant to him — he did not know its history, did not know that the same fluorescent lights had witnessed a whisper and a resurrection fifty years ago — but because a hospital was the controlled environment the experiment required. If the heart stopped, there would be equipment. If the heart stopped and the equipment failed, there would be data. Either outcome was acceptable. What was not acceptable was not knowing.

The heart had stopped. He had felt it — the cessation, the silence inside the chest where rhythm had been, the peculiar quality of a body suddenly unoccupied by its own pulse. He had felt the compressions from the outside, the mechanical pressure of someone else's hands driving his sternum downward, and he had thought, with the clinical detachment of a being who had spent nine centuries examining: *So. The floor is not automatic. It can be reached.*

And then he had seen something.

---

Not light. Not the tunnel and the warmth and the departed relatives that humans reported. Ithuriel did not experience his near-death the way humans experienced near-death, because he was not human, and the dying was not the point. The dying was the method. What he experienced was something closer to a diagnostic — the examiner's instinct, compulsive and unsilenceable, operating even as the body it inhabited lost its hold on function.

He saw the pattern.

Not the pattern as Raziel described it — the macro-architecture of cascade frequencies and species-level trends and the great accelerating curve of human interconnection. Ithuriel had heard rumors of Raziel's data. He had not seen it. What he saw now was smaller. Local. The pattern as it existed in the immediate vicinity of his own cessation — the web of cause and effect that radiated outward from the gurney in Trauma Bay 2 at St. Michael's Hospital at 3:14 a.m. on a Tuesday in February 2035.

He saw it the way he saw everything: as data. The connections were not visual. They were structural — relationships between events, between decisions, between the particular configuration of people and circumstances that had assembled in this room at this hour. A resident who should have been asleep but was not. A charge nurse whose shift should have ended at midnight but had been extended. A bystander who had found him on the bench and had known CPR because her nephew was a paramedic and had taught her at Thanksgiving. The chain of causation that had brought each of these people to this room at this moment, each link forged by a prior decision, each prior decision connected to another chain, and another, and another, the web extending backward through time with a density and precision that his examiner's mind catalogued automatically, compulsively, the way a seismograph records every tremor whether or not anyone is reading the output.

And in the web, an absence.

Not a gap. A gap was passive — a place where something should have been and was not. What Ithuriel perceived was active. A place where the pattern had been interrupted. Where the threads of cause and effect, which should have been continuous — which were continuous everywhere else he looked — had been cut. Severed. Not frayed by accident or entropy but cleanly divided, the way a wire is cut with a tool designed for cutting.

He could not see what had done the cutting. He could see only the cut itself — the signature of removal, the negative space where a connection had existed and no longer did. It was like looking at a circuit board and finding a component missing, the solder points still visible, the traces still running to the empty space where the part should have been. Something had been there. Something had been taken out. And the taking-out had been done with precision, with intention, by something that understood the architecture well enough to know which connection to sever and where.

His examiner's instinct locked onto the absence the way a pathologist's eye locks onto an anomaly in a tissue sample. It was wrong. It was wrong in a way that was not institutional and not systemic and not the product of the failures he had spent nine hundred years documenting. Those failures had a signature — the signature of entropy, of overload, of a system designed for one scale operating at another. They were organic failures. They grew like mold. They accumulated like sediment.

This was not that. This was surgical.

And then the pattern collapsed, because the paddles were on his chest and the electricity was passing through him and his heart was being instructed, by three hundred and sixty joules of direct current and the stubbornness of a twenty-eight-year-old doctor who had been told by her mother to try once more, to resume the work it had stopped doing. And the heart, because hearts are electrical organs and electricity is a language they understand even when they have forgotten every other word, complied.

He came back. The absence came with him.

---

Rebecca stood in the doorway of his room at seven-fifteen. She had been at the nurses' station writing notes when Carlos told her. She walked to the cardiac unit and stopped in the doorway and looked at the man who had been dead thirty-seven minutes ago and was now sitting up.

He was not sitting up the way patients sat up after cardiac arrest — the tentative, disoriented reassembly of a mind returning to a body it had left. He was sitting up the way a man sits up at a desk. Upright. Still. His eyes moved across the room with a slow, scanning attention that was not confusion but inventory. He was looking at the monitors, the IV, the window, the February light, the way a person looks at evidence.

"Good morning," Rebecca said. "I'm Dr. Morrison. You're at St. Michael's. You had a cardiac arrest. We resuscitated you."

The man's gaze settled on her. His eyes were still red-rimmed, still inflamed, but they were focused now, and the focus had a quality she could not place — not the gratitude or disorientation she expected but something more precise. He was looking at her the way a person looks at a piece of data that does not fit the model.

"How long was I down?" he said. His voice was rough. But the words were exact.

"Your heart was in asystole for approximately six minutes. Total downtime, including the bystander compressions and field resuscitation, was roughly twenty-three minutes."

He absorbed this. She could see him absorbing it — the information entering and being filed, categorized, cross-referenced with whatever internal system he was running. His expression did not change. He did not ask the questions patients asked: *Am I going to be okay? What happened? Who found me?*

"Twenty-three minutes," he repeated. "And you continued."

"We did."

"Why?"

The question was not rhetorical. It was not the *why me* of existential crisis or the *why bother* of despair. It was a research question. He was asking about methodology.

"Because we try," Rebecca said. "That's what we do here."

"Past the point where the protocols say to stop."

"Sometimes past that point. Yes."

He looked at her for a long time. His red-rimmed eyes held something she could not read — not surprise, not skepticism, but the expression of a man who has run an experiment and received a result he did not predict, and who is now in the process of revising the model.

"Someone told you to try once more," he said.

Rebecca felt something move through her — a recognition, a displacement, as if the floor had shifted an inch to the left and then back. He had been dead when her mother said those words. He had been flatline, asystole, twenty-three minutes of electrical silence. He could not have heard.

"Yes," she said. "Someone did."

"Who?"

"My mother." The word came out simply. "She's been saying it for fifty years."

The man closed his eyes. He leaned back against the raised bed. His hands — the calloused, weather-roughened hands — lay on the blanket, and they were trembling. Not with weakness. With something else. A recalibration.

"Nine hundred years," he said, barely audible.

"I'm sorry?"

He opened his eyes. "Nothing. I need a notebook."

---

He discharged himself that afternoon. Against medical advice — Rebecca tried to keep him. She stood in the doorway of his room with the AMA form and told him that his heart had been stopped for twenty-three minutes and that they needed to run an echocardiogram and a cardiac catheterization and that leaving was dangerous, that the heart could arrest again, that there might not be another doctor who tried once more.

He signed the form. The signature was precise and illegible, written in a hand that seemed accustomed to a different script.

He stood. He was taller than she had realized — six feet or more, the height concealed by the hospital bed. He put on his coat, the ruined coat, and looked at Rebecca with the red-rimmed eyes, and she saw something in them she had not seen before. Not gratitude. Not the warmth of a man who has been saved. Something colder and more urgent. The look of a person who has found something and cannot stop looking at it.

"Thank you," he said.

"Please stay."

"You already did what mattered."

He walked down the hall. His steps were deliberate, measured, but not the steps of a man relearning how to walk. The steps of a man whose relationship to the ground had changed. As if the floor were different now. As if the data had changed what the floor meant.

He pushed through the exit. The February cold came in through the opened door, and then the door closed, and he was gone.

---

In a park three blocks from the hospital, Ithuriel sat on a bench and opened the notebook he had asked a nurse to bring him — a cheap composition book from the hospital gift shop, the kind with the black-and-white marbled cover that had not changed in a hundred years. He held a pen the way he held everything: precisely, with the minimum grip required for function.

He had tested the hypothesis. The result was not what he had expected. The hypothesis — *can angels die?* — had been answered: apparently not, or at least not easily, or at least not when a human woman with inherited stubbornness and a borrowed philosophy placed paddles on the angel's chest and refused to accept the flatline as final. The answer was interesting. It was not the important thing.

The important thing was the absence.

He wrote. His handwriting was small, angular, the same handwriting that covered the charts in his workspace, the same script that had been cross-referencing failure reports for nine centuries. He wrote the way he examined — without interpretation, without editorializing, laying the evidence on the page and letting it argue.

He described what he had seen. Not the pattern — the pattern was too large to fit in a composition notebook, and he had been glimpsing it for less than a minute, and the glimpse was partial and compromised by the fact that his heart had been stopped at the time and his brain had been running on its residual oxygen and the data was, by any clinical standard, unreliable.

But the absence. The absence he could describe.

A discontinuity in the web of cause and effect. A place where connections had been severed. Not frayed. Cut. The cut was clean, precise, executed with knowledge of the architecture — the kind of knowledge that produced targeted damage rather than random entropy. It was not the signature of a system failing. It was the signature of a system being sabotaged.

He did not write *sabotage.* He was an examiner. He wrote what he observed. He wrote *discontinuity.* He wrote *non-organic severance.* He wrote *evidence of directed interference in the causal architecture of margin events.*

Below that, he wrote a single word.

*Interference.*

Below the word, a question mark.

He closed the notebook. He sat on the bench in the February cold and looked at the sky, which was gray and low and told him nothing, and he felt the ache in his chest where the compressions had cracked his ribs and bruised his sternum, and he felt the cold on his hands and the solidity of the bench beneath him, and he felt something he had not felt in three hundred years. Not faith. Not hope. Not the optimism he had spent nine centuries dismantling with documented evidence.

Purpose.

He had been building a case against the system for nine hundred years. Every failed intervention, every margin case that fell on the wrong side, every documented instance of institutional inadequacy — he had catalogued them all, cross-referenced them, built an archive of failure so comprehensive that it constituted an indictment. The system does not work. The margins are an illusion. The labor is futile.

But the case had a hole in it now. A composition-notebook-sized hole. Because if the failures were not organic — if the entropy was not entropy but interference, if the inadequacy was not inadequacy but attack — then the indictment was wrong. Not wrong about the failures. The failures were real. Wrong about the cause.

The prosecutor had discovered that the defendant was framed.

He opened the notebook again. On the second page, below the clinical notations, he wrote:

*Something is wrong with the pattern.*

He underlined it once. Then again. He stared at the sentence. It was insufficient. It described the symptom, not the disease. But it was a beginning, and beginnings were what examiners worked with — the first anomaly, the first data point that did not fit, the first indication that the model required revision.

He would need access. He would need the full archive — not his own records, which documented field-level failures, but the meta-archive, the one maintained by the being who had been watching from above for a millennium. Raziel's archive. The locked door in the 4th Heaven.

He did not know how to get in. He did not know if Raziel would grant access. He did not know if what he had seen during twenty-three minutes of cardiac arrest was real or was the misfiring of an oxygen-starved brain producing patterns from noise.

But his examiner's instinct said it was real. The instinct was nine hundred years old and had never been wrong about the presence of something hidden, because finding hidden things was his nature, was his name, was the meaning written into him at his creation. *Ithuriel. Discovery of God.* The angel who discovers what is concealed.

Something was concealed.

He closed the notebook. He put it in the pocket of his ruined coat. He stood up from the bench and walked into the February morning, and the city received him the way cities receive everyone — without recognition, without ceremony, one more body moving through the grid of streets and buildings and lives, indistinguishable from any other man in a coat walking alone in the cold.

Behind him, in the hospital, Rebecca Morrison was finishing her notes. She wrote the chart entry the way she wrote all her chart entries — precisely, clinically, the facts laid out in the language of medicine. Male, estimated age mid-forties. Cardiac arrest, asystole, total downtime twenty-three minutes. Resuscitated after multiple rounds of epinephrine and defibrillation. Discharged against medical advice. No identification. No emergency contact. No follow-up possible.

She did not write: *My mother told me to try once more and I tried once more and the heart started.*

She did not write: *He knew. He knew what she said to me. He was dead when she said it and he knew.*

She did not write any of this because the chart was not for these things. The chart was for numbers. The numbers were sufficient. They told the story of a body that stopped and started again, and the starting was attributed to pharmacology and electrical cardioversion and the sustained efforts of a trained medical team, and the attribution was true, and it was complete, and it did not account for the thing that had happened between the word *death* and the word *one* — the space where her mother's voice had arrived not as sound but as structure, not as instruction but as inheritance, three syllables carrying fifty years of accumulated weight, spoken from a doorway at three in the morning by a woman who had been saying them since before Rebecca was born.

She finished the chart. She set down her pen. She sat at the nurses' station in the quiet of a shift winding toward its end, and she thought about the man's eyes — the red-rimmed, examining eyes that had looked at her not with gratitude but with the urgent attention of a person who had found something, and she wondered what he had found, and she would never know, and the not-knowing was the margin between her world and whatever world the man in the ruined coat inhabited, and the margin was everything, and the margin was invisible, and the margin held.

Down the hall, Sarah Morrison was walking toward the exit. Slowly, on knees that had been replaced twice and that carried her with the deliberate, measured pace of a woman who had made every step intentional for decades. She passed the doorway of Trauma Bay 2, where three hours ago her daughter had placed paddles on a stranger's chest and tried once more, and she did not stop. She had said the words. The words had been received. The chain extended forward into hands she would not hold and voices she would not hear, and the extending was the point, and she did not need to watch it happen.

She pushed through the hospital's front doors and into the February morning. The cold pressed against her face. The sky was gray. She pulled her coat tighter — a practical coat, shapeless, the kind of coat she had been wearing for fifty years, the kind of coat that suggested a woman who dressed for weather rather than appearance.

She walked to the bus stop. She waited. The bus came. She got on.

Behind her, the hospital hummed. The fluorescents buzzed at their eternal frequency. The monitors beeped their steady, unspectacular rhythms. In the cardiac unit, an empty bed with rumpled sheets. In the trauma bay, a clean gurney, restocked, waiting. At the nurses' station, Rebecca Morrison, finishing a chart, setting down a pen, pressing her palms flat against the counter and feeling, in the steadiness of her own hands, the proof that trying once more had mattered again, as it always mattered, as it would continue to matter in rooms she had not yet entered, for patients she had not yet met, with words she had inherited from a woman who had inherited them from a silence that spoke.

Try once more. You never know what a life might do.

And three blocks away, on a park bench, a notebook in a ruined coat, a single sentence underlined twice:

*Something is wrong with the pattern.*
