# Chapter 10: Keep Going

**October 2008 — Art School Campus, East Coast**

---

The critique lasted eleven minutes. Elena timed it on the institutional clock behind Professor Lindquist's head, a round white face with a second hand that moved in small mechanical jerks, the kind of clock you find in hospitals and courtrooms and other places where time matters and no one wants to be. She watched the clock the way a person watches something when they cannot look at the one speaking. Eleven minutes for four years of work.

She had carried twelve pieces into the crit room that afternoon and arranged them along the south wall with the care of someone setting a table for guests who mattered. Oils. A mixed-media triptych. The charcoal series she had spent the entire summer on, calling in sick to the frame shop three times in two weeks to finish, losing the job and not caring because the work was the thing, the work was all she had. She had thought about sightlines. She had thought about how the late afternoon light from the tall windows would fall across the brushwork. She had worn the clean shirt, the one without paint on the cuffs, pressed with a borrowed iron in the dorm laundry room at six that morning.

Lindquist sat in the molded plastic chair across from the display. He crossed his legs. He looked at Elena's four years the way a man looks at a receipt he does not intend to keep.

He was fifty-three. He had shown at galleries in Chelsea when Chelsea still meant something, and this history lived in his posture, in the backward lean of his body, in the particular ease of a man who had been relevant and had traded relevance for tenure and was comfortable with the exchange. Elena had admired him once. Genuinely. As a young artist admires someone who has done the thing she wants to do. That admiration had thinned over four years into something more guarded, an awareness that Lindquist's taste was a closed circuit, a system that referenced only itself and admitted no current from outside.

But he signed the review. His name went on the form.

Seven of the eleven minutes passed in silence. He looked at each piece. He wrote something on his clipboard. He removed his glasses, cleaned them on the hem of his black T-shirt -- a gesture Elena had watched him perform in a hundred seminars, a rehearsed performance of thoughtfulness that preceded his most final pronouncements -- and put them back on.

"You're technically skilled," he said.

He said it the way a doctor says *the imaging looks clear* before the rest of the sentence arrives.

"The draftsmanship is above average. Composition is solid. Color theory, obviously, you understand." He gestured toward the charcoal series. "These are accomplished exercises."

The word *exercises* landed with its full weight.

"But they are exercises. There is no risk in them. You are hiding behind the technique." He uncrossed his legs, recrossed them. "I see what you've learned. I cannot see who you are."

Elena sat with her hands folded in her lap.

"Technically skilled but emotionally vacant. That's the gap." He paused. Something shifted in his face, a tightening around the mouth that was not quite professional, not quite personal, something that came from a place Elena could not identify and did not want to examine. "I'll be direct with you, Elena. I don't see a future for you as an artist."

The clock jerked. The second hand completed its circuit.

"I see a future as an illustrator, possibly. A designer. Someone who executes other people's visions competently. But the thing that separates a craftsperson from an artist is the willingness to be seen, and you --" He shook his head. Not with sympathy. With the clinical finality of a man closing a file. "You won't let anyone see you. That might be a cultural thing, it might be a class thing, it might be dispositional. I don't know and it isn't my job to diagnose. My job is to tell you what I see in the work. And what I see is someone who has spent four years learning how to be very good at something she will never be great at."

He stood. He gathered his clipboard and his pen.

"I'm sorry," he said. He did not sound sorry. He sounded like a man who had said the word so many times in review sessions that it had worn smooth, all the contrition sanded off, just a syllable that meant the conversation was over.

He left. The door closed with the pneumatic hiss of institutional hardware.

<!-- AGENT:NOTE — Hidden War seed: Lindquist's cruelty here exceeds professional assessment. "A cultural thing, it might be a class thing" — this is not standard critique language. Something amplified his worst instincts today. Do not explain. Let it sit. -->

Elena sat alone among her twelve pieces. The light from the tall windows moved across the floor in the slow way that late afternoon light moves in October, low and golden and warm on the scuffed linoleum, and the warmth felt like an insult, the way beauty sometimes feels like an insult when you are past the point of receiving it. She looked at her charcoal series and she could see it now, the thing he had named, the careful distance between herself and every mark she had made, every stroke controlled and emptied of whatever might betray the person holding the charcoal.

She had worked so hard to be good that she had taken out everything that might have made the work true.

She sat there. The building made its sounds -- ventilation hum, a guitar playing badly somewhere outside with the cheerful incompetence of a beginner who had not yet learned to be embarrassed, a door slamming on another floor. She did not cry. She had been emptied of crying somewhere between the seventh minute and the eleventh, the tears spent or pushed past or made irrelevant by the thing that had settled into her chest. Not grief. Something flatter. A conviction, smooth and heavy as a river stone. She did not belong here. She had never belonged here.

She packed up the pieces. She carried them down the corridor to her room, two at a time, four trips, the hallway smelling of turpentine and floor wax and the specific warmth of a building full of twenty-year-olds whose lives were still happening. She leaned the twelve pieces against the wall of her room and sat on the edge of the bed and looked at them.

Then she stood up and took her coat from the closet.

---

The roof of Whitfield Hall was not difficult to reach. A maintenance door on the fourth floor, always propped with a wedge of wood because the building's heating system was unreliable and the facilities staff needed access to the rooftop units. Elena pushed through it and stepped onto the gravel and the air hit her like cold water.

October, late afternoon. The day had been warm -- jacket weather, barely -- but up here the wind came across the rooftops from the north and found every gap. The space between collar and neck. The thin skin at her wrists. The strip of ankle above her sneakers. Her coat was a thrift-store peacoat, navy blue, missing one button. Twelve dollars, sophomore year. The nicest coat she owned.

The rooftop was gravel and ventilation housings and the metal boxes of HVAC units that hummed and clicked in their cycles. Ductwork ran along the low parapet wall. Puddles from last week's rain had pooled in depressions in the tar paper, their surfaces holding the sky like small dark mirrors. The city spread out beyond the campus edge -- rooftops, antennae, water towers, the distant geometry of a highway overpass -- but Elena did not look at the city. She walked to the edge.

The parapet was low. Knee-height, poured concrete, with an aluminum railing bolted to its top that came to her waist. The railing was cold under her hands, and she could feel the wind vibrating through the metal, a low constant tremor that seemed to come from inside the building itself, as if the structure were shivering.

Below her, the interior courtyard. Three wings of brick building forming a U around a rectangle of irregular flagstone, sixty feet by forty. Paved pathways cutting diagonals between patches of grass that were still green, not yet killed by frost. A Japanese maple at the center, its canopy a deep arterial red in the October light, the leaves so saturated they looked painted. Benches. A maintenance shed in the far corner. Late afternoon shadows from the fire escapes made geometric patterns on the flagstone -- grids and angles, the shadows of iron railings laid out across the stone like a drawing of a cage.

She leaned her forearms on the railing. Four stories. She could see the distance with the precision of someone who had spent four years studying perspective and proportion. Four stories was enough.

Her parents had driven her here four years ago in her father's pickup, the one with the rust along the wheel wells and the bench seat patched with duct tape. Her mother had packed chicken sandwiches wrapped in foil and a thermos of coffee and a bag of tangerines. Her father had carried boxes up four flights because the elevator was broken, and he had not complained, and he had stood in her room and looked at the cinderblock walls and the narrow bed and he had said, in the matter-of-fact tone of a man who built things for a living: "You're going to do good here, Elenita." He had said it as a measurement, not a hope. The way he said a joint was tight or a wall was plumb.

They called every Sunday. Four years.

She had not told them about the sophomore critique when a classmate said her work looked like "an immigrant's idea of American art" and Lindquist had let the comment stand, had not intervened, had moved on to the next student's work as if the words were weather, just something that happened. She had not told them about the nights in the studio until three in the morning, not from inspiration but from the specific fear that comes from being the only person in the room whose parents did not go to college, the only person who flinched at the price of the oil paints and bought the student-grade acrylics and mixed her own gesso from recipes she found in library books because the premade bottles cost eleven dollars and eleven dollars was lunch for three days. She had told them she was fine. She had told them, that morning on the phone, that the senior review was a formality.

Now she stood on the roof and thought about calling them. She thought about what they would say. She thought about the call that would come tomorrow, when someone from the registrar's office looked up her emergency contact and dialed the number, and the thought arrived flat and weightless, landing on the surface of the conviction and sliding off like water on stone.

This was the thing. Not the height. Not the wind. Not the fall. The nothing. The absence of the feelings that should have stopped her. She searched for them the way you search a coat pocket for keys you know you left there -- grief, guilt, fear, the animal pull of self-preservation -- and found the pocket empty. The emptiness Lindquist had found in her paintings was in her too, had always been in her, and the paintings were just the evidence. *Technically skilled but emotionally vacant.* The diagnosis was total. It covered everything.

The wind picked up. She noticed, with the detached precision of someone cataloging a scene she would not need to remember, that the gravel beneath her feet was a mix of gray and white and rust-colored stones, and that the rust-colored ones were feldspar, and that the palette of the gravel against the aluminum railing and the blue-gray sky was a study in cool neutrals with a warm mineral accent. She was thinking about palettes on the roof of a building she intended to step off. Even this felt like confirmation. Her brain worked this way. She could not turn off the compositional eye. She would always be a person who noticed the quality of light while the content of her life went unattended.

She looked down. The courtyard. The pathways. The maple, its red canopy bright as a wound. Four stories.

And then she saw it.

Not immediately. Her eyes passed over it the way eyes pass over anything that belongs to a landscape. But something caught -- a shape, an interruption in the expected geometry of flagstone and bench and tree -- and her gaze came back the way a hand returns to a rough spot on a smooth surface.

Near the center of the courtyard, between the maple and the south wall. A form on the ground. From four stories up, in the long golden light, she could not see details. She could see shape: a vertical figure, three feet tall maybe, mounted on something flat. One extension reaching upward at close to forty-five degrees. The proportions were rough. Asymmetric. The surface caught the afternoon light in irregular patches -- metal, unfinished, the kind of surface that breaks light instead of reflecting it cleanly. It looked assembled rather than sculpted, built from pieces that had been other things.

Her eye would not leave it.

The figure's reach. The way the rough surface fragmented the light into something more alive than a polished surface would have produced. Shadows pooling in the seams. Highlights catching on ridges and edges. And around the base, scattered across the flagstone in small shifting points -- color. Prismatic color. The glass fragments in the sculpture were catching the October sun and throwing it apart, and the flagstone around the piece was scattered with small rainbows, each one moving as the light moved, shifting and re-forming with the slow precision of something alive.

She had never seen it before. She had crossed this courtyard four hundred times in four years and she had never seen this piece, which meant it was new, which meant someone had placed it here recently, overnight maybe, without announcement, without a placard from the sculpture department, without the careful institutional framing that attended every piece of student work displayed on campus. Someone had made a thing and set it down in the courtyard and left.

Elena took her hands off the railing.

---

Four flights down. The stairwell smelled of industrial cleaner and cinderblock dust and the specific trapped-heat smell of a building whose ventilation was designed for a factory, not a school. Her sneakers on the concrete steps made a sound that was too ordinary for what was happening, which was that she was going down instead of out. Going toward something instead of away from everything.

She did not decide this. That was how she would describe it later, years later, in a studio filled with the scrap-metal sculptures that had made her name, speaking to an interviewer who had asked about the turning point. "I didn't decide to go downstairs. I decided to look at the sculpture. The going downstairs was what looking at it required."

She pushed through the ground-floor exit into the courtyard and the air was different down here. Warmer, closer, the brick walls holding the afternoon heat. The Japanese maple was overhead now, a canopy of red so deep it was almost black at the center, the leaves backlit and translucent at the edges where the sun came through. The flagstone was uneven under her feet. She could hear the guitar player from somewhere above -- still the same three chords, still halting, still patient.

The sculpture was exactly where she had seen it from the roof. Between the maple and the south wall, sitting on a concrete paver that had been set flush with the flagstone. Three feet tall. She crossed the courtyard toward it and the rainbows moved around her feet as she walked, small points of prismatic light sliding across the stone as her angle to the sculpture changed, and she stopped six feet away and looked.

It was a figure. Human, roughly abstracted. Torso, legs braced wide, and one arm raised above the head, the hand open, fingers splayed, reaching for something that was not there. The arm was extended to its full length, the wrist bent slightly as if the effort had torqued it. The body beneath was tilted back to counterbalance the reach, the weight shifted, the posture of someone trying to touch something they were not tall enough to touch. A body on the last inch of its effort.

The materials were scrap. Pieces of angle iron formed the legs. The torso was a section of steel plate, warped and irregular, joined to the legs with weld beads that ran along the seams like raised scars. The reaching arm was rebar -- the kind used in concrete construction, ribbed and gray -- with a hand fashioned from twisted wire, each finger a separate strand bent and shaped into something that was not anatomically accurate and was somehow more truthful than accuracy would have been. The fingers were too long. They reached too far. They wanted something they could not name.

Embedded in the wire and the joints, fragments of glass. Bottle glass -- green, brown, clear -- broken and set into the structure with no apparent system, no pattern Elena could identify, just pieces of broken glass placed where they caught the light and refused to let it pass unchanged. The late afternoon sun entered the glass fragments and came out the other side in pieces, refracted, the white light pulled apart into its components and thrown against the flagstone in small shifting spectra.

The welding was not professional. The beads were uneven, thick in some places, thin in others, with spatter marks where the arc had wandered. Elena could see the penetration of the welds -- the metal had fused rather than merely adhered -- but the technique was functional, not decorative. This was not made by someone who had studied sculpture. This was made by someone who knew how to join metal and had something to say and had said it in the only language available to them.

She crouched down. The flagstone was cold through her jeans. There, leaning against the base of the paver, a card. Index card, white, slightly warped from moisture. On it, in block letters written with a thick marker, the ink still dark:

KEEP GOING

Elena read the words. She reached out and picked up the card and held it. The cardstock was stiff between her fingers. The letters were not even. They had been written quickly, without revision, the kind of writing you do when the words are not the point. The point is what the words say.

She set the card down and placed her palm flat against the figure's torso. The metal was warm. The afternoon sun had heated it, and the warmth went through her hand and into her wrist and up her arm, and the surface was rough under her palm -- weld beads, seams, the grain of steel that had been cut with a grinder and not polished, the slight warping where the heat of the torch had pulled the metal out of true. It was imperfect. It was honest. It was the work of someone who had not hidden behind technique because they had no technique to hide behind.

Something moved in her chest. Below the nothing. Below the flat, smooth surface of the conviction. Not a feeling yet. Not grief or hope or anything with a name. More like ground shifting. A tectonic thing, slow and deep, the nothing cracking along a line so fine it was barely a fracture, and through the crack came something small: curiosity.

Not *why should I live.* That question was too large, too abstract, unanswerable on a courtyard lawn at dusk. The question that came through the crack was smaller. *Who made this?*

And behind it: *How?*

Someone with no gallery, no review, no degree, no audience, no professor's approval -- someone had spent hours welding scrap metal and broken glass into a figure that reached, and had set it down in a courtyard where no one would see it, and had written two words on a card and left. They had not asked permission. They had not submitted it for critique. They had not arranged the lighting or considered the sightlines or worried about whether the proportions followed the rules Elena had spent four years memorizing. They had made the thing because the thing needed to be made.

Art did not need permission.

She had heard this before. In orientation speeches and studio seminars and the books she read about artists who broke rules and changed everything. She had heard it and she had nodded and she had not believed it, because believing required a kind of trust she did not have -- trust that the gate was not the thing, that Lindquist's opinion was not the price of entry, that a working-class kid from Bridgeport with paint under her fingernails and student-grade acrylics could make something real without the institutional machinery confirming it was real. She had believed, in the structural way that beliefs form when you are the first in your family to enter a world that was not built for you, that art required validation before it could be art.

The sculpture did not believe this. It sat on its paver in the courtyard with its one rough arm reaching and its broken glass throwing rainbows across the stone and it did not require Elena Vasquez or Professor Lindquist or the senior review committee or anyone at all to confirm that it was art. It existed because someone had made it. The making was enough.

She stood up. Her knees were cold and her fingers were warm from the metal and the campus was darkening now, the golden light deepening toward amber as the sun dropped behind the west wing, and the shadows of the fire escapes stretched and thinned across the flagstone, and somewhere above her the bad guitarist was still playing, the same three chords in the same patient halting sequence, unashamed.

She looked up at the roof. At the railing where her hands had been ten minutes ago. At the edge. From down here it was just architecture. Concrete and aluminum and gravel. A building doing what buildings do, which is to stand. She looked at it for a long time.

She was alive. Not because she had decided to live. That decision, the conscious and deliberate choice, would come later, in stages, over weeks, the way a bone knits. But because she had decided not to die yet. Not tonight. The distinction was narrow. It was the width of a hairline fracture. It was enough.

---

She went back to her room. She turned on the desk lamp. Her twelve pieces leaned against the wall where she had left them and she looked at them and she saw what Lindquist had seen. The control. The smoothness. The technical skill deployed as armor, every brushstroke calculated to demonstrate competence, every composition arranged to prove she belonged. She had been so afraid of being seen as less than that she had stripped the work of everything that might have been more.

She turned the charcoal series to face the wall. Not in anger. In recognition. The way you close a book you have finished, not because it is bad but because it is done.

She sat at her desk. She opened her sketchbook. She did not draw. She wrote, in pencil, small and fast:

*Found materials. Scrap metal. Broken glass. Start with what's thrown away. Start with what nobody wants.*

Below it, after a pause long enough for the pencil to leave a mark where it rested:

*Keep going.*

She tried to draw the sculpture from memory. The proportions came wrong. The arm was too short, or the torso was too wide, or the angle of the reach was off by degrees she could not calculate. She erased and redrew and the new version was wrong in a different way. She tried a third time and sat back and looked at it.

It should not work. The figure she had seen in the courtyard broke every rule of proportion and balance she had been taught. The arm was too long. The base was too narrow for the lean of the body. The materials were incoherent -- rebar and plate steel and wire and glass, no unity of medium, no consistency of surface. By every metric she had learned in four years of study, the piece should have looked like what it was: junk welded together by someone who did not know what they were doing.

It worked. It caught light. It threw rainbows on stone. It reached.

She wrote below the failed sketches:

*It should not work. It works.*

She wrote the date. October 17, 2008. She did not know yet what any of this meant. She did not know that in six months she would defer the MFA program she had been accepted to and take a job at a salvage yard in New Haven, sorting metal, learning the difference between cast iron and wrought iron and tool steel by the sound they made when struck with a hammer. She did not know that she would start welding in the yard's back lot after hours, with permission from a foreman named Sal who watched her work without comment and one evening brought her a better pair of gloves. She did not know that her first real piece -- built from a car door and a section of chain-link fence and a copper pipe thrown away because it had a bend in it -- would sit in her apartment for two years before anyone saw it, and that the first person to see it would stand in front of it for a long time and not speak and then say, "Where did this come from?" and that Elena would say, "The yard. Everything in it came from the yard," and the person would shake their head and say, "No. Where did it come *from*?" and Elena would not have an answer, because the answer was a rooftop and a courtyard and a sculpture made by someone she never met, and that was not the kind of answer that explained anything.

She did not know that years later, when her name was in galleries and critics wrote about her work, she would go back to the campus. She would drive up on a Tuesday in October and park where her father had parked and walk to the courtyard and find it changed -- the maple larger, the benches replaced, and the sculpture gone. She would ask at the facilities office. A woman behind a desk would check the records and shake her head. They had no documentation of a sculpture in the courtyard. No installation records, no work orders, no maintenance logs. Someone in the art department might know? Elena would call the art department. No one would know.

The maintenance worker who had built it overnight from materials found in the school's waste bins -- angle iron, plate steel, rebar, glass from the recycling, wire from the electrical shop -- and placed it in the courtyard before dawn and walked away without signing it or claiming it or telling anyone, that person would remain anonymous. A presence defined entirely by the work left behind.

Elena would search for years. She would never find them. The sculpture would exist only in her memory and in the failed sketches in a notebook she would keep for twenty-five years, and in the career it made possible, and in the piece she would build in 2024 from another person's discarded work -- a sculpture called "Margins," assembled from filter prototypes she found in a dumpster, the failed experiments of a scientist she had never met whose work she transformed into art without knowing his name or his story or the fact that he had nearly drowned as a child and had devoted his life to clean water and that his discarded failures, in her hands, would become the most important sculpture she ever made.

But that was later. All of it was later. For now Elena sat at her desk in a room on the fourth floor of Whitfield Hall, and the lamp made a warm circle of light on the open sketchbook, and her hands were cold and the pencil was between her fingers and somewhere on the roof the railing she had gripped twenty minutes ago stood in the dark, touched by nothing but weather.

She closed the sketchbook. She stood up and put on her coat -- the thrift-store peacoat, navy blue, missing one button. She put her hands in the pockets. She walked out of her room and down four flights and through the lobby and into the October night.

The air was sharp and clean and smelled like fallen leaves and the particular mineral cold of autumn in the northeast. She crossed the courtyard and passed the sculpture and the rainbows were gone now, the sun below the horizon, but the figure was still there, still reaching, still catching the last ambient light in its rough surfaces, and the card at its base was a white rectangle in the dusk. She did not stop. She kept walking. Through the parking lot and along the road past the athletic fields, her hands in her pockets and her breath making small clouds that the wind took, and the stars were coming out above her, and she walked.

She was alive. Not healed. Not fixed. Not saved, exactly, because the word *saved* implied a story with an ending and this did not have an ending yet, it had only this -- a night, a walk, a pair of cold hands in coat pockets, a notebook with a date and a phrase and three failed sketches. But she was alive. And somewhere below the nothing that still sat heavy in her chest, below the conviction that had cracked but not shattered, the fracture was holding. A hairline opening through which something might grow, given time, given material, given the particular stubbornness of a girl from Bridgeport who had just learned, from a sculpture made of scrap, that the broken things are the ones that catch the light.

*Art from what's broken.*

She wrote it in her notebook the next morning, underlined twice, and below it, the two words that someone had written on a card and left in a courtyard for no one in particular and for her specifically and for everyone:

*Keep going.*
