# Chapter 11: The First Compromise

**September 2010 --- Helios Pharmaceuticals, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina**

---

The anomaly was in column C.

Yuki Tanaka had been staring at the spreadsheet since six-forty that morning --- four hours now, the numbers scrolling past in rows of ten-point Calibri, each row a patient, each patient a body, each body a set of values that the system had already sorted, flagged, and cleared. The system was good at this. The system had been designed by people who understood that clinical data was not a thing to be read but a thing to be processed, and the processing was efficient, and the efficiency was the product of choices made years ago about what mattered and what did not, about which signals to amplify and which to let dissolve into the noise floor, and the choices were reasonable, and the thresholds were defensible, and the data that made it through the filters arrived on Yuki's screen clean and organized and missing exactly the things that the filters had been designed to miss.

She did not trust the filters. This was not paranoia. It was arithmetic. A filter was a function with parameters, and parameters were choices, and choices had assumptions, and assumptions were where the problems lived --- not in malice but in the gap between what someone decided to look for and what was actually there. The gap was usually small. The gap was usually nothing. But Yuki had been trained in pharmacokinetics by a professor at Johns Hopkins who kept a framed quotation on his office wall: *The dose makes the poison. The assumption makes the blind spot.* She had written it in the margin of her first-year notebook and underlined it twice, and then a third time, years later, when she understood what it meant.

So she scrolled through the data manually. All 4,217 patient records from the Phase III trial of Veracetol, Helios's next-generation cholesterol drug, the one that had been in development for six years and in positioning for two, the one that the company's investor presentations called "the post-statin era" and that the research team called, with the dark humor of people who worked eighteen-hour days for salaries that would embarrass their friends in finance, "the mortgage."

Column C: alanine aminotransferase. A liver enzyme. When the liver was stressed --- by alcohol, by infection, by a drug that was supposed to lower cholesterol but was, at some molecular level, doing something else to the hepatocytes --- ALT levels rose. The normal range topped out at 56 units per liter. The automated analysis flagged anything above 120. Between 56 and 120 was a country the system did not visit: elevated but sub-threshold, abnormal but not actionable, the clinical equivalent of a check-engine light that the dashboard had been programmed not to display.

Row 1,847. Patient ID 03-2291. Female, fifty-eight. ALT at 89. Concurrent medications: lisinopril, metformin, acetaminophen.

Yuki wrote the number on a legal pad. Yellow paper, blue ink. She kept scrolling.

Row 2,103. Male, sixty-four. ALT at 94. Concurrent: acetaminophen.

Row 2,588. Female, forty-five. ALT at 87. Concurrent: acetaminophen.

Row 3,016. Male, seventy-one. ALT at 102. Concurrent: acetaminophen.

She pulled twelve cases in four hours. Twelve patients out of 4,217 whose liver enzymes had climbed above the normal range while taking Veracetol alongside acetaminophen. Over-the-counter acetaminophen. Tylenol. The drug that half the adult population kept in their medicine cabinet the way they kept salt in the kitchen --- present, invisible, unremarkable. The drug you took without reading the label because you had taken it a thousand times before and it was fine, it was always fine, it was Tylenol.

The twelve patients had not been hospitalized. None had reported symptoms. Their ALT elevations were subclinical --- the kind of finding that existed in a register below the frequency of alarm, below the threshold where the regulatory system's instruments were calibrated to detect signal. The automated analysis had distributed them across the data set the way a handful of sand distributes across a beach. Individually invisible. Collectively, a texture.

Twelve out of 4,217. Zero point two eight percent.

Yuki printed the twelve records. She highlighted the ALT values in yellow and the acetaminophen entries in blue. She stapled the pages, wrote a note on the cover sheet in the careful handwriting she had inherited from her mother --- a second-generation habit, the penmanship of a woman who had grown up in a household where English was a second language and writing it neatly was a form of proof --- and she picked up the pages and held them for a moment, feeling their weight, which was negligible, and their significance, which she could not yet measure.

She took the stairs to the third floor.

---

Martin Hale's office faced the courtyard. Through the window, a Japanese maple that had been planted when the building opened in 1996 threw moving shadows across the carpet, and the shadows shifted as the branches shifted, and the effect was of a room that breathed.

He was fifty-three. Twenty-two years at Helios. He had the kind of face that communicated steadiness the way a brick wall communicates load-bearing capacity --- not handsome, not interesting, but solid, constructed for purpose. On his desk: a framed photograph of twin daughters in soccer jerseys, a coffee mug that read WORLD'S OKAYEST MANAGER, and three stacked binders labeled VERACETOL P3 INTERIM / VERACETOL P3 FINAL / VERACETOL FDA SUBMISSION PREP. The binders were tabbed and color-coded. The tabs were aligned. Martin Hale was a man who aligned tabs.

He was also, by the standards of pharmaceutical middle management, a decent man. He had once delayed a submission by three weeks over a single data point that turned out to be a transcription error. The delay cost four hundred thousand dollars. His director had called it a "learning opportunity," which was the corporate dialect for a reprimand that stopped short of consequence. Martin had accepted the language and ignored the message, because the alternative was submitting data he was not certain of, and Martin Hale did not submit data he was not certain of. This was his reputation. He had earned it by losing four hundred thousand dollars, and the earning had taught him something the losing had not --- that the pharmaceutical industry operated on acceptable margins of uncertainty, and that the art of the work was in knowing which uncertainties to accept.

He knew. He was good at it. He had spent twenty-two years getting good at it.

Yuki knocked on the open door. He looked up from his monitor, saw the stapled pages, saw her face, and his expression shifted --- not alarm, not irritation, but the particular resignation of a man who recognizes the opening notes of a conversation he has had before and knows how it ends.

"Come in," he said. "Close the door."

She sat. She handed him the printout. She watched him read.

This was something she had learned to do early --- watch the first ten seconds. A person's initial reaction to unwelcome information contained more signal than the subsequent ten minutes of managed response. The managed response was performance. The first ten seconds were data.

Martin's eyes moved down the page. His jaw tightened at the note she had written on the cover sheet. He set the pages down and placed both hands flat on his desk, fingers spread, the posture of a man bracing against something that had not yet arrived.

"Twelve patients," he said.

"Twelve out of four thousand two hundred seventeen. Zero point two eight percent. All with concurrent acetaminophen use."

"And the ALT levels are sub-threshold."

"Below the 120 cutoff, yes. Range of 87 to 102. But the normal ceiling is 56. These patients are running one-and-a-half to two times the upper limit of normal. If they stay on Veracetol long-term with continued acetaminophen use --- and Martin, people take acetaminophen the way they drink water --- the hepatic stress could accumulate."

"Could."

The word sat between them. It was doing what the word *could* always did in these conversations --- it was being accurate and being insufficient at the same time.

"Could," she said. "I can't say would. Not with this data. We'd need a targeted sub-study. Six months minimum, maybe twelve. A sub-cohort on combined therapy with serial liver panels."

Martin picked up the printout again and looked at it the way a man looks at a repair estimate on a car he cannot afford to fix. Not with anger. With the arithmetic of constraint.

"Yuki," he said. "How many drugs have you seen go from Phase III to submission since you've been here?"

"Two. Loritab and the migraine compound."

"And the Loritab submission. The GI adverse events."

"Zero point eight percent."

"Zero point eight percent. Which the FDA agreed, after sixteen months of additional review, was within acceptable limits. And we lost sixteen months. And Genovex beat us to market with their version, which had a GI event rate of one point two percent, but they submitted on schedule." He paused. He was not building a case. He was describing a landscape. "I'm not saying the flag was wrong. You know I supported it."

"I know you did."

"I'm saying the system has thresholds for a reason. The FDA has epidemiologists, toxicologists, biostatisticians --- people whose entire career is evaluating exactly this kind of signal. And the hepatic threshold for requiring additional study is a hundred and twenty units per liter. Your patients are below that."

"Just below."

"Below is below."

Yuki did not answer immediately. She had rehearsed this conversation on the way up the stairs, the way she rehearsed all important conversations --- running the dialogue forward, mapping the decision tree, identifying the nodes where the argument could branch and preparing responses for each branch. She was good at this. Her intelligence was the kind that anticipated, that modeled, that saw the shape of a conversation three exchanges before it arrived. It was the quality that had gotten her hired and the quality that now, sitting across from Martin Hale's reasonable face, felt less like a gift than a trap. She could see exactly where this was going. She could see it the way you see the bottom of a staircase from the top --- every step clear, every step leading down.

"If we flag this," she said, "what happens?"

Martin leaned back. The chair creaked. The Japanese maple's shadows moved across the wall.

"We pull Veracetol from the submission queue. We design a targeted sub-study. That takes, optimistically, twelve months to run and six to analyze. The FDA will want the results before they review the primary submission. Eighteen months, minimum."

"The cost?"

"Direct --- twenty, twenty-five million for the study. Indirect --- delayed revenue, market position, competitor response --- closer to two hundred million." He said this without heat, the way you read a tide table. These were the numbers. The numbers did not care how she felt about them. "And that's the optimistic scenario. If the sub-study finds nothing --- which it might find nothing, Yuki, that's a real possibility --- then we've spent two hundred million dollars and eighteen months to confirm that zero point three percent of patients experience a subclinical liver enzyme elevation that resolves when they switch from Tylenol to Advil."

"And if we don't flag it."

"Then the drug goes through standard submission. The FDA reviews the full data set, including the hepatic panels. If their reviewers catch the interaction --- and they have good people, they might --- they'll request additional data. If they don't, the drug goes to market with standard labeling that recommends periodic liver monitoring for all patients on long-term therapy. The zero point three percent experience mild elevations their doctors catch on routine bloodwork. The doctors adjust the dose or tell them to switch analgesics."

He looked at her.

"It's not liver failure. We're not talking about organ damage. We're talking about enzyme elevations in a fraction of a percent of patients taking a specific combination that's already flagged for general monitoring."

"There's something else," he said.

Yuki waited.

"The patients who need this drug. The ones with LDL above 190 who can't tolerate statins. About two million people in the US alone. They've been waiting. If we delay by eighteen months, some of them will have cardiac events they wouldn't have had. Some of them will die." He held up a hand. "I'm not being dramatic. The actuarial models are straightforward. An eighteen-month delay in a major cholesterol drug translates to a calculable increase in cardiac mortality."

"You're telling me the math says to let it go."

"I'm telling you the math doesn't have a clean answer. I'm telling you there isn't a version of this where nobody gets hurt."

He was right. She knew he was right. Not in the way that a losing argument is still wrong but the other person is more powerful --- in the actual way, the real way, the way that made this worse rather than better. Martin Hale was not suppressing her findings. He was not ordering her to falsify data. He was not the pharmaceutical villain from a courtroom drama, the man in the expensive suit who says *bury it* while a jazz score plays behind him. He was a decent man in a messy situation, explaining the math. The math was real. The two million patients were real. The eighteen months were real. The four hundred thousand dollars he had once spent on a transcription error were real, and they had taught him something she had not yet learned, which was that the cost of caution was also measured in lives.

This was the texture of the work. Not good versus evil. Not right versus wrong. Two kinds of harm, two populations of patients, two stacks of numbers, and a woman at a desk whose job was to choose which stack to look at and which to set facedown.

"Okay," Yuki said.

Martin studied her face. He was doing what she had done --- reading the first ten seconds.

"Okay?"

"I'll note the interaction in the secondary analysis appendix. Standard documentation. No formal flag."

He nodded. He held out the printout and she took it and the pages were warm from the heat of his hands, and the yellow highlights caught the window light, and she folded them once and put them in the pocket of her lab coat.

"For what it's worth," he said, "I think this is the responsible call."

She stood. She wanted to be out of the office before the architecture of justification could add another floor --- before Martin's reasonable voice could lay another brick on the structure that was building itself inside her, mortared with phrases like *thresholds exist for a reason* and *the math doesn't have a clean answer* and *responsible call*. Each phrase load-bearing. Each phrase correct. The structure rising.

"I know," she said.

She walked back downstairs. She sat at her desk. She opened the spreadsheet.

In the secondary analysis appendix, in the subsection reserved for findings that did not rise to the level of formal safety signals, she typed four sentences: *A sub-cohort analysis of patients with concurrent acetaminophen use (n=12, 0.28%) revealed ALT elevations ranging from 87--102 U/L. These values fall below the threshold for clinical significance (120 U/L) and do not constitute a safety signal requiring further investigation at this time. The interaction is noted for inclusion in post-marketing surveillance protocols. No additional action is recommended.*

Forty-three words. She typed them in eight minutes. Then she sat at her desk for another twelve, her hands on the keyboard, not typing, staring at the cursor blinking at the end of the last period.

*No additional action is recommended.*

It was true. It was also not true. It was a sentence that occupied the space between those two things --- defensible under any audit, survivable under any review, a sentence engineered to document a finding without triggering its consequences. It was the kind of sentence the system produced naturally, the way a river produces sediment, through the steady erosion of something solid into something that could be carried along without resistance.

It was the first sentence she had ever written that she was not proud of.

She saved the file. She closed the spreadsheet. She went to the cafeteria and bought a turkey sandwich and a coffee. The sandwich was dry. The coffee was adequate. She ate at a table near the window and watched the landscaping crew move across the corporate campus on their riding mowers, cutting the grass in precise, overlapping lines, and the smell of cut grass came through the ventilation system and mixed with the cafeteria's industrial coffee smell and the result was a scent that should have been pleasant and was instead flat, neutral, a smell that belonged to nowhere and no one.

---

The afternoon passed. She attended a two o'clock meeting about the Veracetol marketing timeline. She reviewed a colleague's protocol for a new cardiovascular trial. She answered eleven emails, each one a small machine for converting uncertainty into action items and action items into the appearance of progress. She walked to the parking lot at six-fifteen.

September in North Carolina. The air was warm and dense, holding the day's heat the way a sponge holds water, and the sky above the Research Triangle was the color of a healing bruise --- purple at the edges, pale yellow at the center where the sun was going down behind the office parks and pine stands. Yuki drove home on the same roads she always drove, past the same strip malls and apartment complexes and gas stations and fast-food franchises, and the world outside her windshield was identical to the world she had driven through that morning, before the anomaly, before Martin Hale's office, before the four sentences in the appendix. The sameness was the thing. The world had not changed. She had written forty-three words and the world had not even flinched.

Her apartment was a one-bedroom in a complex called The Meridian, which was not located on any meridian and did not contain anything that merited the name. Beige walls, beige carpet, a kitchen with white laminate counters and appliances that were new in 2006 and had already crossed into the territory of things that function but no longer impress. She had moved in three years ago, when Helios hired her, and had furnished the place with the efficiency of someone who understood that she would spend most of her waking hours at work and therefore did not need her home to be anything more than a place where sleep and meals occurred. A couch from Target, gray. A dining table from IKEA, birch veneer. A bookshelf full of pharmacology journals and, on the top shelf, three novels in Japanese that her mother had sent from San Jose and that Yuki had been meaning to read for two years.

She made rice. She opened one of the packets of instant miso soup her mother mailed every month --- the ones with the small foil pouches of dried tofu and wakame that unfurled in the hot water like something remembering its own shape. She ate at the kitchen table. The soup was good. The rice was good. The food tasted like food, and this was, in its own way, information. She was not destroyed. She was not experiencing the crisis of conscience the movies would have assigned her --- the anguished pacing, the tortured phone call to a friend, the long stare into a bathroom mirror. She was eating miso soup at her kitchen table in North Carolina on a Tuesday evening, and the soup was warm, and outside the window the parking lot lights had come on, casting their sodium-yellow circles on the asphalt, and she was fine.

She washed the dishes. She checked her email. She read a journal article on CYP3A4 inhibition that she had been putting off for a week. She brushed her teeth. She changed into a T-shirt and sweatpants. She turned off the overhead light and turned on the desk lamp and sat on her bed and looked at the wall.

Zero point two eight percent. Twelve patients. Sub-threshold. Subclinical. The words moved through her mind with the smooth, frictionless quality of things that had been designed to move through minds without catching --- rounded, polished, the vocabulary of institutional reassurance, each word a stone worn smooth by the current of a thousand conversations just like the one she had had with Martin Hale. The words worked. They were doing their job. They were correct, and they were sufficient, and they slid through the machinery of her conscience the way a Veracetol tablet slid through the machinery of a body, doing the thing it was supposed to do while also, perhaps, at some dose, in some combination, in some fraction of a percent of cases, doing something else.

She opened her laptop. The screen's blue light filled the room.

She was not looking for anything. She opened her browser and typed the address for PubMed, the biomedical literature database, and in the search field she typed *acetaminophen hepatotoxicity chronic low-dose interaction* and pressed Enter. The results loaded --- 2,341 articles, sorted by relevance. She clicked the first one. A 2008 study from *Hepatology*. She read the abstract: chronic low-dose acetaminophen use in combination with drugs metabolized via the CYP2E1 pathway --- Veracetol's pathway --- showed evidence of cumulative hepatic stress in a murine model. Sub-threshold in short-term observation. Statistically significant over twelve months.

She read the abstract twice. She clicked the second article. A 2006 meta-analysis. Same conclusion, different data, different species, same direction. Chronic, low-level, cumulative. The kind of harm that did not announce itself in the first year or the second but built the way sediment builds in a pipe --- invisibly, incrementally, until the flow rate changed and someone noticed, and by then the pipe was already narrowed, and the narrowing was structural.

She closed the laptop. She opened it again. She navigated away from PubMed and opened her personal email --- the Gmail account, not the Helios address. She clicked Compose. In the To field, she typed the first three letters of an address she had memorized during graduate school the way you memorize the location of a fire extinguisher: *med@fda.gov*. The MedWatch general submission inbox. The FDA's adverse event reporting system. She had never used it. She had never needed to.

She typed a subject line: *Potential hepatotoxic interaction --- Veracetol (HL-4419) and acetaminophen*.

She stared at the subject line. Then she moved the cursor to the body of the email and began to type. She typed the patient numbers. She typed the ALT values. She typed the PubMed citations. She described the interaction in clear, unpadded language --- the language of a scientist reporting a finding to other scientists, stripped of the bureaucratic anesthesia she had applied in the appendix, written in the voice she had been trained to use, the voice that said *here is what I found, here is what it means, here is what I think we should do about it*.

Three paragraphs. She read them twice. She moved the cursor to the Send button.

She did not click it.

She sat with the cursor hovering over the blue rectangle for a duration she would not afterward be able to reconstruct --- three minutes or ten or somewhere between, a stretch of time that had no clock in it, only the weight of calculation. She thought about Martin Hale. She thought about the eighteen months. She thought about the two million patients with LDL above 190. She thought about the twelve patients with ALT above 87. She thought about patient 03-2291, the fifty-eight-year-old woman, and whether that woman reached for the Tylenol bottle when she had a headache, the way everyone reached for it, without reading the label, without thinking, because Tylenol was Tylenol, because some things were safe the way the ground was solid.

She thought about her mother, who took Tylenol for her arthritis. Two tablets, twice a day, every day, for years.

She thought about the specific weight of a career --- seven years of graduate school, the postdoc, three years at Helios, the papers and the conferences and the morning commutes and the cafeteria lunches and the small, daily accumulation of a professional life, all of it resting on the foundation of a reputation, and a reputation was a thing that could crack. One anonymous email. One investigation. One question at the wrong meeting --- *Who reported this?* --- and the career she had built with the same careful, controlled precision she brought to everything would fracture along a line she could already see, the way a geologist could see the fault in the rock.

She selected all the text. She deleted it. She closed the laptop.

She sat on the bed in the dark, the laptop closed on the dining table, the blue light gone, the room lit only by the parking lot's sodium glow through the blinds. The refrigerator hummed in the kitchen. A car passed on the road outside. The building's HVAC system ticked and settled in the walls.

She had made the same decision twice in one day. Once in Martin Hale's office, once in her own apartment. She had expected the second time to be harder --- the way touching a bruise is harder than getting the bruise, the body's memory amplifying the pain. But it was not harder. It was easier. The path was already worn. The justification was already built and furnished and lit, ready to be walked through without slowing down. The neural architecture of the first compromise had made the second one effortless, the way a river cuts a channel and then the channel is there and the water has no choice but to follow it.

That was the thing she had not expected. Not the guilt. She had prepared for guilt. What she had not prepared for was the ease.

She got up. She went to the kitchen. She opened the cabinet above the refrigerator --- the one where she kept the wine, the bottles her college roommate had gotten her in the habit of buying, reds she chose by the label because she had never learned to choose them by anything else. She pulled down a bottle of Malbec. She opened it. She poured a glass. She took the glass back to the bed and sat down and drank.

The wine was fine. It was drinkable and unremarkable, a $12 bottle from the grocery store that did what $12 bottles of wine were supposed to do, which was to make the distance between a person and her thoughts slightly larger.

She thought about the word *compromise*. Two meanings. A negotiated settlement --- give something, get something, meet in the middle. And a structural weakening. A compromised foundation. A compromised immune system. A compromised integrity, which did not mean integrity that had been negotiated but integrity that had been damaged, undermined, reduced in its capacity to bear weight.

She had done the first kind. She was certain of this. She had weighed the evidence and the cost and the competing harms and she had arrived at a reasonable conclusion shared by her reasonable supervisor in a reasonable process governed by reasonable thresholds, and the conclusion was: let it go. Note it. Document it. File it. Move on. The system would catch it if it mattered. The FDA would see what she had seen. The doctors would monitor their patients. The thresholds existed for a reason. The math was the math.

She drank the wine. She did not pour a second glass. She set the glass on the nightstand and lay back on the bed and stared at the ceiling, which was white and featureless, the kind of ceiling that existed in apartment complexes across the country, applied by contractors who were paid by the square foot and did not linger over the work, and in the dark the ceiling was not white but a dim, ambient gray, the color of nothing, the color of the space between two things.

The data was still on her work computer. The twelve records. The yellow highlights. The blue highlights. The four sentences in the appendix. *No additional action is recommended.* The data would be there in the morning. It would be there next week and next year and in 2015 and 2020 and 2024, sitting in the secondary analysis appendix of a Phase III submission, forty-three words in a subsection that no one would read unless they were looking for it, and no one would be looking for it because the thresholds had been met and the filters had functioned and the system had done what the system was designed to do, which was to process the data and produce an outcome and move on.

In fourteen years, she would be forty-seven. In fourteen years, the drug would have been on the market for over a decade, and the twelve cases would not be twelve but twelve hundred, and the interaction would not be subclinical but fatal, and the combination of Veracetol and long-term acetaminophen use would have caused cardiac events in patients whose liver damage went undetected because the damage accumulated below the monitoring threshold, and the monitoring threshold was 120, and the damage started at 87, and the distance between 87 and 120 was thirty-three units of enzyme and fourteen years of silence, and the silence would be hers.

She did not know this. Not as fact. Not as certainty. But she lay on her bed in the apartment in North Carolina and she felt it --- not knowledge but its shadow, the shape of the thing she was choosing not to see, pressing against the wall she was building to contain it. She was a pharmacokineticist. She understood dose-dependent curves. She understood the difference between acute toxicity, which announced itself, and chronic toxicity, which arrived like weather --- slowly, systemically, over a time horizon longer than any clinical trial was designed to measure. She understood, with the precise, unspareable intelligence that was both her greatest asset and the thing that would not let her sleep tonight, that the twelve cases were not a finding. They were a question. And she had chosen not to ask it.

She closed her eyes. She thought about the morning. She would drive the same roads. She would park in the same lot. She would walk through the same lobby and ride the same elevator and sit at the same desk, and the spreadsheet would be there, and the four sentences would be there, and Martin Hale would be upstairs in his office with the Japanese maple and the aligned tabs, and the submission would proceed on schedule, and the drug would reach the two million patients who needed it, and the twelve patients --- or twenty, or fifty, or a number she could not calculate because she had chosen not to run the calculation --- would take their Tylenol without reading the label and their livers would do what livers do under chronic low-level stress, which was to compensate and compensate and compensate until they could not.

The wine sat on the nightstand. The parking lot light came through the blinds. The refrigerator hummed.

Yuki Tanaka was thirty-three years old, and she had made her first compromise, and the next one would be easier. She knew this. She knew it the way she knew the dose-dependent curve, the way she knew the shape of a threshold, the way she knew that the distance between the first drink and the second was always shorter than the distance between sobriety and the first. She had studied this. She had published a paper on it --- not about wine, about hepatotoxicity, about the way the liver's capacity to metabolize a toxic load decreased with each successive exposure, each cycle of damage and repair leaving the tissue slightly less resilient, slightly more vulnerable, until the load that the organ had carried without complaint for years became, without warning, the load that broke it.

The analogy was not subtle. She could see it from where she lay. She could see it and she could name it and she could do nothing with the naming, because the naming was not the problem. The problem was that she had already decided. The problem was that the decision was correct. The problem was that a correct decision could still be the first in a sequence that ended somewhere she did not want to go, and the sequence was already in motion, and the motion was her own.

She slept. When she dreamed, she dreamed of columns --- not architectural columns but spreadsheet columns, rows of numbers scrolling downward in the dark, and in the dream the numbers were not values but names, and the names were not data but people, and the people stood in a line that stretched past the edge of what she could see, patient and silent, their faces turned toward her with the neutral expectation of those waiting for something they had been promised.

She woke at six. She showered. She dressed. She drove to work. The morning was bright. The parking lot at Helios Pharmaceuticals was filling up. The Japanese maple outside Martin Hale's window had begun to turn --- the first hints of red at the leaf margins, the pigment change that happened every September as the chlorophyll withdrew and the underlying color, the color that had been there all along beneath the green, became visible.

She did not think about the email she had not sent. She would not think about it for fourteen years, and then she would think about nothing else.
