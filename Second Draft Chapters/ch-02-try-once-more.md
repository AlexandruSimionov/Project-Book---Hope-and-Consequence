# Chapter 2: Try Once More

**March 1985 — St. Michael's Hospital, Queens, New York**

---

Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen.

Sarah Morrison counted compressions the way other people counted prayers — mechanically, desperately, with the fading belief that the numbers themselves might be enough to hold something together. Her palms locked against the sternum, the heels of her hands stacked, elbows straight, shoulders burning. Beneath her the body of Rosa Chen rose and fell with each push, the thin hospital gown rucked to one side, electrode pads stuck to the pale skin of her chest.

Seventeen. Eighteen.

The cardiac monitor drew its flat green line across the screen like a sentence with no verb. No activity. No response. Just the steady, accusatory whine of a machine reporting what everyone in the room already knew.

"Ventilating," said Denise, the charge nurse, from the head of the bed. She squeezed the Ambu bag with two hands, forcing air into lungs that accepted it the way an empty room accepts furniture — without opinion, without resistance, without any indication that the air was being used for anything.

Sarah kept pushing. Twenty. Twenty-one.

Room 714 at three in the morning had the quality of a place where time had thickened. The fluorescent tubes overhead were set to their nighttime dim, casting the room in a light that made everything look older and less certain than it was. Two nurses, a respiratory therapist named Carl, and Sarah — the full arrest team for a Saturday overnight, which was the same as saying the only people awake in this wing of the hospital who still had something left to give. The crash cart stood open beside the bed, its drawers pulled out at angles, syringes and vials and tubing arranged with the organized chaos of a kitchen in the middle of a meal. The defibrillator sat on the lower shelf, charged, waiting, its paddles resting in their cradles like hands with nothing to hold.

Twenty-eight. Twenty-nine. Thirty.

"Pulse check," Sarah said.

She stopped compressions. The room held. Denise pressed two fingers against Rosa Chen's carotid and waited, her face still, her eyes tracking the monitor. Carl watched the ventilator readings. Linda, the younger nurse, stood at the foot of the bed with her hands already positioned to rotate in when Sarah's arms gave out.

The monitor showed nothing. The flat line continued its horizontal crawl.

"No pulse," Denise said.

Sarah resumed compressions. One. Two. Three.

---

She had been at this for eighteen minutes.

Eighteen minutes was not a number she had to read from a clock. It was a number she could feel in her shoulders, in the acid burn crawling through her triceps and deltoids, in the locked-joint ache of her elbows and the wet heat at her temples where sweat had soaked through her hair. Eighteen minutes of chest compressions at a hundred beats per minute — one thousand and eighty individual downward thrusts against the ribcage of a seventy-one-year-old woman whose sternum had developed the alarming flexibility of cartilage giving way. She had felt the crack on the fourth minute, the subtle pop of a rib separating from its cartilaginous attachment, and she had kept going because that was what you did. You broke the ribs. You pushed through the breaking. The alternative to broken ribs was death, and death was not an alternative Sarah Morrison was prepared to offer.

Not tonight. Not this one.

She did not know Rosa Chen. This was not a relationship. Sarah had been at the nurses' station reviewing labs on a post-op gallbladder when the code was called — overhead speaker, that three-tone chime followed by the flat announcement, *code blue, room 714, code blue, room 714* — and she had set down her coffee and gone. Third-year residents went to codes the way dogs went to dinner: reflexively, without negotiation, because the training had built a neural pathway between the sound and the response and there was no room left in the circuit for hesitation.

She had arrived to find Rosa Chen in ventricular fibrillation, Denise already doing compressions, the room still sorting itself into its emergency configuration — monitors powered up, cart rolling in, the respiratory therapist pulling the intubation kit. Sarah had taken over compressions. She had ordered the first epi. She had shocked the heart three times at escalating joules and watched the monitor settle back into its trembling, useless fibrillation every time.

What she knew about Rosa Chen: seventy-one years old. Admitted six hours earlier with acute anterior wall MI — a heart attack large enough to damage the main pumping chamber, the kind of infarction that killed more patients than it spared. She had been stabilized. Then destabilized. Then stabilized again. Then the fibrillation had started, and the fibrillation was the body's admission that the heart muscle, battered and oxygen-starved, had lost the ability to coordinate its own contractions. Instead of pumping, it shivered. Instead of circulating blood, it sat in the chest like a fist that could not decide whether to open or close.

What she noticed: Rosa Chen was small. Not just short but diminished, the way certain elderly patients seemed to withdraw into themselves, pulling their mass inward as if to take up less room in a world that had grown too large. She weighed perhaps a hundred pounds. Her hair was white and had been braided — someone had taken the time to braid it before bringing her in, a gesture of care that meant someone out there loved this woman enough to think about her hair on the worst night of her life. The braid lay across one shoulder, the tip fraying where the elastic had come loose during the initial resuscitation. On her right hand, a thick ridge of callus ran along the inside of her index finger. A lifetime of holding something — a needle, a knife, a pen.

Someone's hands. Someone's particular life.

Sarah pushed. Seven. Eight. Nine.

---

The arithmetic of dying was not something they taught in medical school, but every resident learned it anyway, the way you learned the location of the vending machines and which attendings would cover for you if you needed to sleep — through accumulation, through observation, through the grim education of standing at bedsides and watching what happened when the numbers went wrong.

The arithmetic said this: after a cardiac arrest, the brain survived on its residual oxygen for approximately four minutes. After four minutes, neuronal damage began. After ten minutes, the damage was significant. After twenty minutes, you were no longer resuscitating a person — you were resuscitating a body, and the difference between the two was the difference between saving someone and preserving something, and any doctor who told you they didn't think about that distinction while doing compressions was either lying or had not yet been doing this long enough to learn how to count.

Eighteen minutes. Eighteen minutes of epinephrine and atropine and three countershocks and continuous CPR, and the heart had not responded. Not once. Not a twitch. The flat green line ran across the monitor like a road through a landscape where nothing lived.

Sarah's arms shook. Not the fine tremor of adrenaline but the heavy, involuntary vibration of muscles approaching failure. She could feel the lactic acid pooling in her forearms, could feel her grip weakening with each cycle, the force of her compressions diminishing by measurable degrees even as she tried to compensate by driving more from her shoulders, from her back, from whatever reserves of physical effort remained in a body that had been awake for twenty-two hours and on its feet for the last nine.

She had eaten half a granola bar at eleven. She'd had four cups of coffee since starting her shift at five the previous afternoon. Her feet ached in the way that meant the arches had given up hours ago and were now simply enduring. Her lower back had been sending dispatches of formal complaint since midnight, each one more insistent than the last. She was running on caffeine and something harder to name — not adrenaline, not hope, but the stubborn, structural refusal to stop that substituted for both when both had been used up.

Fifteen. Sixteen.

"Dr. Morrison."

Denise's voice. Gentle. Professional. The tone of a woman who had worked overnight codes for twenty years and had learned how to deliver a suggestion inside a statement, the way a good carpenter could drive a nail with a single stroke.

Sarah did not look up. "Yes."

"Eighteen minutes."

"I know how long it's been."

"Vitals haven't changed. We've given four rounds of epi. Three shocks. There's been no response."

Sarah said nothing. She pushed. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen.

"The brain —" Denise began.

"I know about the brain."

Silence. The monitor whined. The ventilator hissed its mechanical breath. Somewhere down the hall, another patient's call button chimed and was answered and went quiet.

Sarah looked at Denise. The charge nurse met her eyes with the expression that Sarah had been seeing all week from nurses and attendings and senior residents — the look that said *this is the part where you stop*, the look that said *you've done enough*, the look that managed to convey both compassion and finality in a single set of the jaw. It was not unkind. It was the look of people who had been through this enough times to know the difference between trying and prolonging, between effort and futility, between the doctor's need to fight and the patient's need to be let go.

Sarah understood the look. She understood the arithmetic. She understood that Rosa Chen's heart had been in fibrillation for eighteen minutes and that the epinephrine had done nothing and the shocks had done nothing and her own hands, cracking ribs and compressing a chest cavity that offered less and less resistance with each cycle, were doing nothing except delaying the moment when someone in this room would have to say the words.

She looked at Rosa Chen's face. The eyes were closed. The mouth was slightly open, the jaw slack around the endotracheal tube. The skin had taken on the waxy, yellowish cast of poor perfusion, the blood draining from the surface and retreating to the core the way an army retreats to its last defensible position. It was a face that had laughed and wept and argued and kissed and squinted into sunlight and fallen asleep watching television and done all the ten thousand things that a face does across seventy-one years of being alive, and now it was doing the thing that faces do when the body beneath them has decided, with the quiet authority of exhaustion, that it is finished.

Linda and Carl exchanged a look. Sarah saw it. She had been seeing looks like that all week — the lateral, wordless communication of experienced staff who had developed a grammar of glances that meant *it's time* and *she's gone* and *the young resident doesn't know when to stop.* She did not blame them. They were probably right. They had been doing this longer than she had, and the thing about experience was that it taught you where the line was, and the thing about the line was that it existed whether you acknowledged it or not.

"Okay," Sarah said. Her voice came out flat, emptied. The voice of a woman who had learned to announce failure as if it were a clinical finding, a data point, a number on the chart. "Time of death —"

She stopped.

---

There was no sound. That was what she would remember later, turning the moment over and over across the years the way you turn a stone in your hand, examining it from every angle, never finding the surface that explained what it was. There was no voice. No whisper she could point to and say *I heard that, those words, in that register, from that direction.* Nothing so concrete. Nothing so evidential.

What there was: a shift. A change in the quality of the air, or of her own attention, or of the space between the two — she could never determine which. As if the room had drawn a breath. As if something had leaned close, not to her ear but to the part of her that made decisions, the part that lived below language and below thought in the territory of instinct, and had pressed against it the way a hand presses against a closed door — not forcing it open but letting you know that the door exists, that there is something on the other side, that you have a choice you did not know you had.

*Try once more.*

Not words. Not exactly. More like the memory of words, or the shape that words leave after they've been spoken, the way a bell leaves its tone in the air after it stops ringing. Something in her shifted. The arithmetic didn't change — eighteen minutes was still eighteen minutes, the odds were still the odds, the brain was still accumulating damage with every second that passed. But beneath the arithmetic, underneath the numbers and the probabilities and the clinical judgment that said *stop*, something else asserted itself. Something older than her training. Something that had nothing to do with evidence or protocol or the reasonable, defensible, professionally appropriate decision to call the time.

Her father on the kitchen floor. She had not thought about that in months, had spent years building the architecture of a professional composure that kept that memory stored in a room she did not enter, but now it was here — not as grief, not as trauma, but as information. Her nine-year-old hands on his chest. The linoleum, cold against her knees. The way she had pushed and pushed and pushed without knowing what she was doing, without technique or training or any expectation of success, driven by nothing more than the refusal to stop while someone she loved was dying. She had not saved him. She had been nine and had not known what she was doing and the heart attack had been massive and unsurvivable and no amount of small hands pressing against a cooling chest would have changed the outcome. She knew this. She had always known this.

But she had tried.

She had tried, and the trying had mattered — not because it had worked, not because it had changed the outcome, but because it was the thing she had brought to that moment. Her effort. Her presence. Her refusal. And the trying had become the foundation of everything she had built since — every class, every rotation, every night on call, every patient she had fought for and every patient she had lost. The trying was the structure. Remove it and the rest collapsed.

Sarah did not say *time of death.* She said:

"One more round."

Denise looked up from the chart where she had been preparing to record the time. Her pen hovered. "Doctor?"

"One more round. Charge to three-sixty. Push another epi."

The room recalibrated. It was a small thing — a fractional shift in posture, in expectation, the team adjusting from the loose, depleted stance of ending to the tighter configuration of trying. Linda moved to the drug cart. Carl checked the ventilator. Denise set down the pen with the careful deliberateness of someone who wanted the action to be visible, to be noted, to be part of the record of this room and this night: *the pen was set down.*

Sarah adjusted her position. She shifted her weight forward over the bed, realigning her shoulders directly above her hands, finding the angle that would let her drive from her core rather than her exhausted arms. She checked her hand placement — heel of the right hand on the lower half of the sternum, left hand interlocked on top, fingers lifted to keep the force concentrated on the bone rather than the ribs. She had done this a thousand times. She had done this for eighteen minutes tonight. She did it now as if for the first time, with a precision that felt less like training and more like prayer.

"Epi's in," Linda said.

"Charged to three-sixty," said Carl.

"Clear."

The room pulled back. Sarah placed the paddles against Rosa Chen's chest, one to the right of the sternum, one to the left, and pressed the discharge buttons.

The body jumped. The monitor scrawled its wild artifact — the electrical noise of the shock obliterating all information for a long, suspended second during which nothing could be read and nothing could be known. Then the artifact cleared. The line returned.

It was not flat.

Sarah stared. The line was — it was doing something. Not the chaotic trembling of fibrillation and not the flat nothing of asystole but something between the two, a faint, tentative, irregular stuttering, the heart's equivalent of a hand reaching for a surface in the dark.

"Hold compressions."

She stepped back. Her hands dropped. Everyone watched the monitor.

The stutter organized. Not cleanly — there was nothing clean about it. The rhythm lurched and faltered and found itself and lost itself and found itself again, a pattern assembling itself from its own wreckage, the electrical system of Rosa Chen's heart remembering a sequence it had performed three billion times across seventy-one years and, for reasons that no amount of pharmacology or electrophysiology could fully account for, deciding to perform it again.

A QRS complex. Then another. Then a gap that lasted long enough for Sarah's own heart to clench — and then a third. A fourth. The intervals were uneven, the complexes wide and ugly, but they were complexes. They were organized electrical activity producing organized mechanical contraction producing a pulse.

"Sinus rhythm," said Denise, and her voice cracked on the word *rhythm*, a tiny fracture in twenty years of professional composure. "Rate fifty. Fifty-two."

Linda pressed her fingers against Rosa Chen's wrist. Waited. Looked up. "I have a pulse." Her face held an expression that Sarah could not name — not surprise, not relief, something rawer than either, the look of someone who has watched something happen that their experience told them should not have happened.

"Fifty-four," said Carl.

"Blood pressure," Sarah said, because the training was the only thing still running, the only system inside her that had not locked up. "I need a blood pressure. And a sat."

"Seventy-six over forty-eight. Coming up."

"Pulse ox eighty-eight. Rising."

"Get a twelve-lead. ABG. Portable chest." The words came out in the clipped cadence of a resident who had drilled this sequence so many times it ran without conscious input, the procedural scaffolding holding her upright while everything else inside her reorganized itself around the fact that the woman on the bed was alive. "I want continuous cardiac monitoring. Someone call Kessler and tell him she's back. I want eyes on her every fifteen minutes. If she throws another run of V-fib, I want —"

Her voice stopped. Not because she ran out of instructions but because her throat closed, the muscles seizing in the way that muscles seize when the body has decided, without consulting the mind, that it is time to feel what has been deferred. She pressed her lips together. She breathed through her nose. She blinked twice, hard.

"I'll stay with her," Linda said. She said it softly. She said it the way you say something to a person who is about to break and who needs a reason to leave the room before they do.

Sarah nodded. She peeled off her gloves. Her hands were shaking — both of them, a deep, full-body tremor that started in her fingers and ran up through her wrists and forearms and into her shoulders. She let them shake. It felt like something she had earned.

She looked at Rosa Chen one last time. The chest rose. Fell. Rose again. The braid on her shoulder shifted with each breath, a small, ordinary movement, the kind of motion that nobody noticed in the course of a normal day because it was simply what living bodies did — they moved, they breathed, they shifted. The callused hands lay on the blanket, and Sarah could see the pulse in the wrist now, the faint throb visible beneath the papery skin.

She turned and walked out of the room.

---

The hallway was empty. The fluorescent lights buzzed at their nighttime frequency, turning the linoleum into a long gray river of reflected light. Sarah walked five steps from the door of Room 714 and stopped and leaned her back against the wall and slid down until she was sitting on the floor with her knees drawn up and her hands in her lap and the wall cold and solid against her shoulder blades.

She cried.

Not from relief. That was what people assumed later, when the night became a story she told — that the tears were a release, a decompression, the body's celebration of a victory. But that was not what she felt, sitting on the cold linoleum at three-fifteen in the morning with the fluorescent lights buzzing above her and the distant beeping of monitors drifting down the hall. What she felt was terror. A delayed, overwhelming terror at how close she had come to stopping.

She had been about to say the words. *Time of death.* The first syllable had been in her mouth. She had been reaching for the clock, had been composing the number — three-eleven, or three-twelve, whatever the time had been, it didn't matter, it was going to be a number on a chart, a line under a name, the end of a specific, particular, irreplaceable human life. And she had been ready to say it. She had been ready to stop.

She had nearly given up.

The tears came fast and messy, the way tears came when you were too exhausted to manage them. She pressed the heels of her hands against her eyes and breathed in shuddering draws and let the hallway hold her the way the wall held her, solidly, without judgment, without any need for her to be composed or professional or the kind of doctor who did not sit on the floor at three in the morning and cry.

What had stopped her? What had turned her from the clock back to the patient, from the words *time of death* to the words *one more round*? She did not know. She would spend the rest of her career not knowing. She would tell the story a hundred times — to students, to residents, to colleagues at conferences, to her husband on the nights when the work followed her home — and she would always arrive at the same gap in the narrative, the same missing step between *I was going to stop* and *I didn't stop*, and she would fill the gap with different words at different times. Instinct, she would say. Training. The stubbornness that ran in her family like a genetic marker. A feeling. A sense. Something.

She would never say *a voice.* She would never say *someone told me.* She would say *something* and leave the something unexamined, a closed room in the house of her memory, because she was a scientist and a doctor and a woman who believed in evidence, and the evidence said that Rosa Chen's heart had restarted because the final combination of epinephrine and high-energy defibrillation had, on the fourth attempt, achieved the precise electrochemical conditions necessary to convert fibrillation to sinus rhythm. That was the evidence. That was the explanation. It was true, and it was complete, and it accounted for every observable fact.

It did not account for the way the room had felt in the moment before she decided to try again. But rooms did not have feelings, and moments did not lean in, and the space between a decision and its opposite was not occupied by anything except the neurochemistry of a tired brain making one more calculation. She believed this. She also believed that something had spoken to her, and she held both beliefs the way she held the shaking in her hands — without trying to stop them, without trying to reconcile them, without any expectation that they would resolve into a single, coherent truth.

She wiped her face with the back of her hand. She breathed. She stood up.

---

The waiting room at St. Michael's was down the hall and through two sets of double doors, and Sarah pushed through them because she needed to sit somewhere that was not the floor outside a patient's room, and because the break room coffee would require walking further than her legs were willing to go.

The room was small and poorly lit — three of the fluorescent tubes dead, the remaining two casting the orange plastic chairs in a dim, uncertain glow. A television in the corner played silent news, the anchor's mouth shaping words that no one was awake to read. A man in a Con Edison uniform was asleep against the wall. A woman in a bathrobe had fallen asleep against the vending machine, her face pressed into the Plexiglas at an angle that would leave a mark. An old copy of *Reader's Digest* lay open on a chair, its spine cracked, its cover half-detached.

Three-twenty in the morning. The congregation of the stranded.

Sarah dropped into a chair near the door and let her head fall back against the wall. Her body reported its damages: the burn in her shoulders, the ache in her lower back, the deep fatigue in her forearms that would make her hands clumsy for the rest of the shift. Her scrubs were damp with sweat at the collar and under the arms. Her hair had come loose from its knot and hung in dark strands against her neck. She looked, she imagined, like a woman who had been in a fight. In a way she had.

Rosa Chen was alive. The thought arrived without fanfare. It was a fact, like the hum of the fluorescent tubes, like the stale air, like the sleeping man's hardhat balanced on his knee. Rosa Chen, seventy-one, admitted with acute MI, coded for twenty minutes in Room 714, and she was alive. Her heart was beating. Her lungs were exchanging oxygen. Her blood was circulating. All the unremarkable, essential, astonishing functions of a living body, continuing.

Sarah closed her eyes. Behind her lids, the afterimage of the monitor — the flat line, the flat line, the flat line, and then the spike. That first spike. Not a full rhythm, not a heartbeat, just a single electrical hiccup, a twitch in the green flatness, the cardiac equivalent of an eye opening in the dark. She would carry that image for sixty years. She would describe it to hundreds of students, each time trying to capture the exact quality of the moment when nothing became something, when absence became presence, when a line that had been dead began, tentatively and with no guarantee, to live.

She would not always succeed in the description. The moment resisted language the way certain experiences resisted language — not because it was mystical or transcendent but because it was both ordinary and impossible at the same time, and language was better at capturing one or the other than both.

She opened her eyes.

There was a woman sitting in the far corner of the waiting room.

Sarah had not noticed her when she came in, which meant either the woman had been very still or Sarah had been very tired. Probably both. The woman sat in the chair beneath the dead television, her coat still on — a dark coat, shapeless, the kind of practical garment that suggested someone who dressed for weather rather than appearance. She held a paper coffee cup in both hands, the way you hold something when you are not drinking it but not ready to let it go, when the warmth of the cup is the point rather than its contents.

She was not sleeping. Her eyes were open, directed at the hallway doors through which Sarah had just come, and her expression was — Sarah could not read it. Not grief. Not anxiety. Not the blank, waiting-room patience of someone watching the clock for news. Something quieter. Something more settled. The expression of a person who had been sitting in uncomfortable chairs for a very long time and had made her peace with the sitting.

The woman's gaze moved to Sarah. Their eyes met. It lasted a second, maybe less. Then the woman looked away, back toward the darkened hallway, and took a slow sip of her coffee.

Sarah considered speaking. She was not sure what she would say — *Are you waiting for someone? Can I help? It's late* — the standard phrases of a hospital worker encountering a person in a waiting room at an hour when waiting rooms should be empty. But the woman did not look like she needed help. She looked like she belonged there, in the way that certain people belonged in certain places — not because anyone had sent them or because they had a reason you could write on a form, but because they were there and had been there and would continue to be there after everyone else had gone home.

Sarah did not speak. She turned and looked at the vending machine and thought about coffee and thought about Rosa Chen and thought about the fact that she had nearly given up and had not, and that the distance between those two things — giving up and not giving up — was the distance of one more try.

*One more round. Charge to three-sixty. Push another epi.*

That was all. That was the entire margin between a living woman and a dead one. Not a brilliant diagnosis, not a heroic intervention, not a flash of medical genius. Just the decision, made for no reason she could articulate, to do the thing one more time.

She sat with this. She would sit with it for the rest of her life.

---

At three-forty-five she stood up, went to the break room, and poured herself coffee from the pot that had been on the burner since eleven. It was black and thick and tasted like something that had given up on being coffee hours ago and had settled for being hot and dark and approximately liquid. She drank it standing at the counter, both hands around the cup — the same posture as the woman in the waiting room, though she did not notice the echo.

Her pager was quiet. The hallway was quiet. She thought about Mr. Aguilar on Tuesday and Mrs. Patterson on Thursday and the week's accumulated weight of failure, and she thought about how strange it was that the thing holding her up tonight was not a success in any dramatic sense but something simpler — a refusal. She had refused to stop. She had refused to accept the flat line as the final answer. She had tried once more, and the once more had been enough, and she did not understand why, and the not understanding felt less like ignorance than like the edge of something larger, the border of a territory she could see but not enter, a country that existed on the other side of the arithmetic where the numbers gave way to something the numbers could not measure.

She did not know what to call that territory. She would not know for years. She would eventually settle on a phrase that was not quite a name and not quite a prayer — *the space where you try once more* — and she would use it the way some people used scripture, as a touchstone, a centering point, a place to return to when the work became too heavy and the losses stacked up and the coffee was bad and the fluorescent lights were the same flat yellow they had always been and always would be.

She would tell her residents: *Always try once more. You never know what a life might do.*

She would say it gently to the ones who had just lost a patient. She would say it firmly to the ones who wanted to stop too soon. She would say it quietly to herself on the nights when the arithmetic said there was no point, when the numbers were against her, when the reasonable and responsible and clinically defensible thing to do was to stop. She would say it because she had learned it here, in this room, on this night, at this hour, standing over a seventy-one-year-old woman whose heart had stopped and whose life was measured in the distance between giving up and not giving up.

She did not know that the woman she had just saved would die in six months. She did not know about the daughter, or the grandson who would not be born for years, or the story Rosa would tell from her hospital bed about a woman made of light. She did not know that the woman in the waiting room — the one with the coffee cup and the dark coat and the expression Sarah could not read — had been sitting there for six hours, waiting not for a patient but for a doctor, waiting for Sarah to make a decision that would ripple outward through decades of lives she would never meet.

She did not know any of this. She was twenty-eight years old, and her arms hurt, and the coffee was terrible, and she had work to do.

She rinsed the cup. She put it in the sink. She checked her pager. She went back down the hall toward Room 714, where Rosa Chen lay breathing — each breath a quiet, ordinary thing, the kind of thing that no one wrote down or measured or thought about until it stopped, and then the absence of it was the only thing in the room.

Sarah pushed open the door. Linda looked up. The monitor beeped its steady, unspectacular rhythm.

"How is she?"

"Stable. Sinus rhythm, rate sixty-two. Pressure's eighty-eight over fifty-six and climbing."

Sarah nodded. She pulled a stool to the bedside and sat. She picked up Rosa Chen's hand — the one with the callus, the one that had held things for seventy-one years — and she held it. Not because there was a medical reason. Not because it would change the prognosis or alter the treatment plan or show up in the chart. She held it because the hand was warm, and because warmth was its own evidence, and because she needed to feel, in her own palm, the proof that trying once more had mattered.

Rosa's fingers twitched. A reflex, perhaps. Or perhaps not.

Sarah held on.

Outside, in the waiting room, the woman in the dark coat finished her coffee and dropped the empty cup into the trash can by the door. She pulled her coat tighter. She stood, slowly, the way a person stands when they have been sitting for a long time and their body has opinions about the transition. She walked to the hospital's front entrance and pushed through into the March wind, and the door swung shut behind her, and she was gone.

Sarah did not see her leave. She was watching the monitor, counting heartbeats the way she had counted compressions — steadily, faithfully, with the belief that the numbers were enough to hold something together. And maybe they were. Or maybe it was something else entirely. She would spend the next sixty years trying to decide, and she would never manage it, and that was all right.

The monitor beeped. Rosa Chen breathed. The fluorescent lights hummed their indifferent hum.

Try once more. You never know what a life might do.
