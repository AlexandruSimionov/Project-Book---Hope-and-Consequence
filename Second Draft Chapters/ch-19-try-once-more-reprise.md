# Chapter 19: Try Once More (Reprise)

**Queens, New York -- April 2020**

---

The N95 smelled like the inside of a rubber glove. Sarah Morrison had been wearing it for eleven hours and the smell had become the smell of the world -- chemical, synthetic, the opposite of air. Beneath the mask, a face shield that fogged when she exhaled too hard, forcing her to calibrate her breathing into the shallow, measured draws of someone rationing atmosphere. Beneath the face shield, a surgical cap that pressed her hair flat against her skull and left a crease above her ears that she could feel but not see. Over everything, a yellow isolation gown that rustled when she moved and clung to the sweat on her forearms and turned her body into a shape that had no identity, no gender, no face -- a figure in plastic, one of dozens moving through the seventh-floor COVID ward at St. Michael's Hospital in the steady, sealed choreography of a pandemic April.

She was sixty-three years old. Chief of Medicine. She had been at this hospital for thirty-five years, and for thirty-five years the coffee at the nurses' station had been terrible, and the fluorescent lights had buzzed at the same frequency, and the linoleum had reflected the same jaundiced yellow, and the work had been the work. But the work had never been this.

The seventh floor had been medical-surgical six days ago. Now it was sealed with plastic sheeting at the stairwells, the conference room converted to overflow, the break room converted to overflow, the storage closet where Sarah had once gone to cry after losing a patient in 1991 -- her private room, her one concession to grief -- now full of ventilators. Twenty-three patients. Nineteen on ventilators. Two ventilators available. Four patients in the ER who needed them.

The math did not require a calculator. The math required a philosopher, and philosophers were in shorter supply than ventilators.

---

Rounds at six a.m. Eight residents gathered at the whiteboard, which Sarah had written by hand because the electronic system had crashed for the second time that week. Names. Numbers. Oxygen saturation. Ventilator settings.

She stood at the board with a dry-erase marker in her gloved hand and felt the ache in her right knee, the one she had been ignoring since February. Her feet, in the compression socks her daughter had mailed her -- *Mom, you need these, I read about them* -- were swollen and hot inside shoes she had been wearing for sixteen hours. The body at sixty-three was a different instrument than the body at twenty-eight. It played the same music, but the keys stuck, and the tuning drifted if you did not attend to it.

James Park stood at the back. Fourth-year fellow, thirty-one, slight and precise, with the kind of attentiveness that patients trusted before he said a word. He wore his N95 with the straps crossed at the back -- the standard configuration pressed a scar behind his left ear, and the crossing had become his signature on the ward.

"Mrs. Delgado in room three is declining," said Lauren, a third-year whose face had been reshaped by exhaustion. "Sats dropped to eighty-one overnight."

"Mr. Hassan in seven is improving," James said. "Sats up to ninety-four on forty percent. He could come off in the next twenty-four hours."

"Potentially," Lauren said.

Sarah wrote the numbers on the board. She wrote them because writing was movement, and movement was simpler than the thing that happened when she stopped moving and let the numbers settle into meaning. She capped the marker. She looked at the residents -- cohort after cohort, the faces changing while the expression stayed the same: exhaustion, determination, and the particular terror of people learning that medicine was not a science of answers but a practice of choosing among insufficiencies.

She told them about Rosa Chen.

She had not planned to. The story came the way it always came -- triggered, not summoned, called up by the particular chemistry of fluorescent light and tired faces and the sensation of standing in a room where the math said there was not enough. She told them about 1985. The three a.m. code. The eighteen minutes of v-fib. The nurses' look. She told them about the moment she had opened her mouth to call time of death and something -- she did not say what, she never said what -- had intervened.

"I was your age," she said to James. "Third-year resident. The attending had gone home. I was alone with a seventy-one-year-old woman whose heart had been in v-fib for eighteen minutes, and everyone in that room was ready to stop, and I was ready to stop, and I tried one more time."

The residents listened. Some had heard the story before. Sarah told it to every cohort, the same way, the same pause before the ending. It was not a speech. It was a ritual.

"She lived. Rosa Chen. Eighteen minutes of v-fib, nineteen shocks, and she converted to sinus on the last one." She had told this story a hundred times. The telling had worn it smooth, stripped it to its essential components the way water strips a stone. But the stripped-down version still had an edge. "She went home to her daughter. She held her daughter's hand."

She looked at the whiteboard. The names. The numbers.

"You never know what a life might do," she said. "That's what I want you to carry. Not optimism. Optimism is a feeling, and feelings don't survive this. Carry the uncertainty. When you're standing at a bed and the math says stop, remember that the math doesn't know what happens after."

James watched her from the back. Above the crossed straps of his mask, his eyes held something she recognized -- the expression of a person who had just been given a frame for something they already felt but could not name.

---

The patient arrived at 2:47 p.m.

Margaret Calloway, forty-four years old. COVID pneumonia, eight days of symptoms, oxygen saturation falling. Her son had driven her from a house in Ozone Park after Margaret's breathing became the kind of breathing that did not sound like breathing. The son had left her at the ER entrance because visitors were not allowed. He had watched through the glass doors as she was taken inside. He had driven home to his sister and his younger brother, who was twelve, and he had sat at the kitchen table and waited.

Sarah saw the chart at three-fifteen. Age: 44. Comorbidities: asthma, managed; hypertension, controlled. Bilateral ground-glass opacities, oxygen saturation 74 percent on fifteen liters, respiratory rate 36, declining. The team had intubated her in the ER. She was on the ventilator now -- one of the two available, freed that morning when Mr. Hassan came off his, as James had predicted. In any other year the timing would have been called luck. In 2020 it was called the daily lottery of resource allocation.

By four o'clock, Margaret was coding.

---

The alarm sounded at the nurses' station and Sarah was already moving. Not toward the room but toward the sound -- the Pavlovian response of thirty-five years of answering alarms. She pulled on a fresh pair of gloves in the hallway, the latex snapping against her wrists with the sound that had punctuated every emergency of her career. She checked her face shield. She pushed through the door.

Margaret Calloway lay on the bed, small inside the machinery -- the ventilator and the IV poles and the monitor and the yellow gown and the tubes, all of it dwarfing her the way the hospital always dwarfed the patient, reducing the person to a body and the body to a problem. Her heart was in v-fib. The monitor showed the trembling, purposeless rhythm that Sarah had seen a thousand times -- the same rhythm Rosa Chen's heart had shown in 1985, in a room three floors below this one.

James was already there. He had started compressions. His hands were stacked on Margaret's sternum, his arms straight, his body rocking forward with each push in the controlled, rhythmic cadence of someone who had been trained well and who brought to the act the full weight of his attention, as though each compression were not routine but singular.

"V-fib," said the nurse. A woman named Priya, seven years on the floor, the flat and measured voice of someone who had learned to deliver information without editorializing it. "Three minutes."

"Charge to two hundred," James said.

The defibrillator whined. The sound was the same as it had always been -- high, dental, a frequency that lived behind Sarah's eyes. The same whine it had been when she was twenty-eight and shaking in a yellow-lit room with Rosa Chen's braid coming undone on her shoulder.

Sarah stood in the doorway. She did not take over. James was running the code, and he was running it well. She had learned over decades that sometimes the most important thing a teacher could do was stand in the doorway and let the student make the call.

"Charged."

"Clear."

The shock. The body's involuntary jump. The monitor: artifact, then the same trembling fibrillation. Nothing.

"Resume. Epi, one milligram."

The drug went in. Compressions continued -- James's gloved hands on the sternum, the bed shaking with each thrust. Sarah watched his hands. They were steady. He was steady. Above the mask, his eyes tracked the monitor with the focused attention of someone who was not ready to accept the line on the screen as the final answer.

"Six minutes," Priya said.

James shocked again. Nothing. Again. Nothing. Sarah watched from the doorway and thought about the whiteboard upstairs. Two ventilators. Four patients in the ER. She let the math sit. She did not act on it.

"Ten minutes," Priya said. The voice was neutral. The same flat tone Denise had used in 1985. Different nurse, different decade, same subtext.

James looked at Sarah.

She knew what he was seeing. The Chief of Medicine in the doorway. Sixty-three years old. The authority to call it. He was looking for permission -- not to stop exactly, but to be told to stop, because stopping on your own was a different act than being instructed, and the difference mattered, and he knew it mattered, because she had taught him that it mattered without ever using those words.

"Twelve minutes," Priya said. "Doctor?"

James looked at the monitor. He looked at Margaret Calloway -- at her face, which was slack and gray behind the endotracheal tube, which revealed nothing about who she was or who waited for her in a house in Ozone Park. He looked at the nurse. He looked at Sarah.

"One more round," James said. "Charge to three-sixty. Push another epi."

The nurse looked at Sarah. The look was the same look. Thirty-five years later, different eyes, same question. *Is this the young doctor who doesn't know when to stop?*

Sarah said nothing. She did not nod. She did not intervene. She stood in the doorway and let James make the call, because the call was his to make, because this was the moment -- not the telling of the story at morning rounds, not the philosophy or the words, but this, the standing in the room with a patient whose heart was not beating and choosing, against the arithmetic, to try once more. This was the transmission. This was how it passed from one pair of hands to the next.

"Epi's in."

"Charged."

"Clear."

The shock. The body. The monitor.

Artifact. Then --

A line. Not fibrillation. Not asystole. A rhythm. Tentative, irregular, stumbling forward the way Rosa Chen's heart had stumbled forward in 1985 -- the same groping, uncertain quality, the organ feeling its way back into a pattern it had lost.

"Sinus," Priya said. Her voice had changed. The flatness was gone. "Rate of -- forty-eight. Fifty. Fifty-two."

James took his hands off Margaret Calloway's chest. He stepped back. His arms were trembling -- the deep, structural tremor of muscles that had been working past their limit. Above the mask, his eyes were wet.

"Blood pressure?"

"Seventy-six over forty. Coming up. Eighty over forty-four."

"Sats?"

"Eighty-five. Eighty-seven. Climbing."

Sarah watched the numbers. She watched them the way she had watched them in 1985 -- with the total attention of a woman who had nothing left to give except the act of watching, the act of being present while a life decided whether to continue. The ventilator hissed. The monitor beeped its steady, organizing rhythm. Margaret Calloway's chest rose and fell.

"Nice work," Sarah said to James. Her voice was not steady. She did not try to make it steady.

James nodded. He pulled off his gloves. His hands were trembling, and he did not make fists to stop them. He let them shake.

Sarah recognized the shaking. She had shaken the same way in a hallway at three in the morning thirty-five years ago, after Rosa Chen's heart restarted, after the thing she could not explain, after the moment that had become the foundation of everything she had built since. She had let her hands shake then too. It had felt earned. It still did.

---

In the anteroom outside the ward, Sarah removed the PPE in the prescribed order. Gown first -- untie, peel, fold inward, dispose. Gloves -- pinch, peel, dispose. Hand sanitizer. Face shield off. Hand sanitizer. N95 last -- bottom strap over the head, top strap over the head, discard. Hand sanitizer a third time. She had done this forty times today. The routine was mechanical, the body performing the steps while the mind went elsewhere.

But today, peeling the gown from her shoulders, she felt the separation differently. The layers coming off, one by one, and underneath them: her body. Her scrubs, damp with sweat. Her face, creased by the N95 -- two deep red lines running from her cheekbones to her jaw, the mask's brand.

She looked at her hands. Sixty-three. The veins stood out more than they used to. The knuckles were larger. These were not the hands of a twenty-eight-year-old resident who had held defibrillator paddles over Rosa Chen's chest. These were the hands of a woman who had been holding things for thirty-five years -- paddles and pens and coffee cups and the hands of dying patients and the hands of living ones -- and the holding had left marks.

She walked to the break room.

---

The break room had been converted to overflow two days after the ward opened, but they had since reclaimed a corner of it -- a folding table, two plastic chairs, a microwave, and a coffee maker that produced something closer to hot water than coffee. Someone had taped a piece of printer paper above the coffee maker. It read: THIS COFFEE IS TERRIBLE AND SO IS EVERYTHING. Underneath, in different handwriting: HANG IN THERE. Underneath that, in a third hand: NO.

Sarah poured coffee into a paper cup and sat. The break room was empty -- rare, this week. For the past six days it had been a relay station, residents cycling through in fifteen-minute shifts, eating granola bars, staring at phones, falling asleep in the chairs. But right now, in the lull between the code and the next crisis, the room was hers.

She drank the coffee. It was terrible. The terribleness was familiar -- hospital coffee, the same category of bad since 1982. The coffee at St. Michael's in 1985 had been terrible. In 1995, in 2005, in 2015, terrible. Some things were constant. The lights buzzed. The linoleum reflected yellow. The coffee was bad. Patients coded and you either saved them or you didn't, and afterward you sat in a room and drank the bad coffee because the bad coffee was the bridge between the last emergency and the next one.

The silence pressed in. Not real silence -- the ventilation hummed, the lights buzzed, a pager chirped down the hall. But silence enough. The kind that opened a door she usually kept closed.

Rosa Chen. Room 714. Three in the morning, 1985. The braid coming undone. The callused hands. The monitor's flat green line and then the spike -- that first spike, tentative, uncertain, the heart's equivalent of an eye opening in the dark. She had carried that image for thirty-five years the way some people carried a photograph in their wallet, a talisman touched in difficult moments.

She had been twenty-eight. The attending had gone home. The nurses had given her the look. She had opened her mouth to say *time of death* and something had stopped her. Thirty-five years, and the gap in the narrative was the same -- a missing step between the decision to stop and the decision to try once more, and in that missing step something had lived, something that was not a voice and not a thought and not an instinct but something between all three, or beneath them.

*Try once more.*

She had built a career on those words. Said them to every resident she had ever trained -- gently to the ones who had just lost a patient, firmly to the ones who wanted to stop too soon, quietly to herself on the nights when the arithmetic was against her. The words had become institutional culture. They were part of St. Michael's the way the bad coffee was part of St. Michael's -- embedded, invisible, load-bearing.

And the words had cost. Some residents had carried them and saved lives. James. Lauren. Others she could name. But some had carried the words too far -- had not learned the other lesson, the one she did not teach as well: when the trying became its own kind of damage. When the one-more-round was not for the patient but for the doctor. She had watched residents burn through their reserves, watched the trying consume them, watched the philosophy she had given them become a weight they could not set down. A second-year who had worked a code for forty-five minutes on a patient with terminal cancer because she could not stop, because *always try once more* had lodged in her like a splinter and she could not distinguish between trying once more and trying forever. The resident had transferred to pathology three months later. Dead patients, she said, were easier. They had already stopped.

Outside, through the window, the parking lot was full of refrigerated trucks. She knew what was in the trucks. Everyone knew. The trucks hummed at a frequency just below attention, the mechanical drone of a thing that should not have been there and was.

She set the cup down. She picked up her phone.

---

Rebecca answered on the third ring.

"Mom?"

"Hi, sweetheart."

"Are you okay? You sound tired."

"I am tired."

"You should sleep."

"I will. I'm taking a break. I wanted to hear your voice."

A pause. The particular pause of a thirteen-year-old who was old enough to understand that when her mother called from the hospital and said *I wanted to hear your voice*, the sentence meant something more than its words. Rebecca was sharp that way. She had her father's analytical mind and her mother's stubbornness and a capacity for reading between lines that Sarah sometimes found unnerving in a child.

"How is it there?" Rebecca asked.

Sarah looked at the break room. The sign above the coffee maker. The plastic chairs. The window with its view of the refrigerated trucks.

"It's a lot," she said.

"Are people --" Rebecca stopped. Started again. "Are you being careful?"

"I'm being careful."

"Mrs. Torres said her sister is a nurse and she hasn't been home in a week."

"I came home two days ago."

"For four hours."

"I came home."

Another pause. Sarah could hear the apartment -- the television, the particular domestic quiet of a thirteen-year-old alone in a two-bedroom during a pandemic, doing remote school and making herself sandwiches. Sarah's ex-husband had wanted to take Rebecca to Connecticut. Sarah had said no, because the irrational geography of a mother's worry said nearby was safer even when nearby was the epicenter. She might have been wrong about that. The wrongness sat in her chest alongside the coffee and the exhaustion.

"I have an essay due Friday," Rebecca said.

"What's it about?"

"We have to pick a person we admire and write about why."

"Who did you pick?"

"I'm deciding between Nellie Bly and Ida B. Wells."

Sarah smiled behind the phone. Journalists. Both of them. Rebecca had been reading about journalists since she was eleven, building a private library of women who had gone places they were not supposed to go and written about what they found. She wanted to be a journalist. She had said so with the total conviction that comes from not yet knowing how many times a life can change direction.

"Good choices," Sarah said.

"I think Ida B. Wells. Nellie Bly is more famous but Ida B. Wells is more important."

"That sounds like a thesis statement."

"It is. Mrs. Okoro said we need a thesis statement in the first paragraph."

"Mrs. Okoro is right."

Sarah sat with the phone pressed to her ear and listened to her daughter breathe. The ordinariness of it -- a thirteen-year-old on the couch in her pajamas -- was the most valuable thing Sarah had encountered all day. More valuable than the code save. More valuable than Margaret Calloway's climbing stats. The sound of her daughter breathing in a warm room.

"Bec?"

"Yeah?"

"Whatever you end up doing -- journalism, or something else -- when the moment comes that you want to stop, when you've done everything you can think of and it hasn't worked and you're tired and you want to quit -- try once more."

She heard herself say the words and heard, beneath them, every other time she had said them. To residents. To colleagues. To herself. The words were smooth from use, worn by decades into something less a sentence than a shape. But saying them to Rebecca was different. Saying them to her daughter was not teaching and was not ritual. It was inheritance.

Rebecca was quiet for a moment. "Is this a doctor thing or a life thing?"

"Both."

"Okay."

"I mean it."

"I know you do, Mom."

Sarah closed her eyes. Behind her lids, Rosa Chen's monitor -- the flat line and then the spike. Thirty-five years ago, in a room three floors below where she sat now, she had tried once more and a woman had lived, and the living had become a story, and the story had become a philosophy, and the philosophy had become the sentence she was saying to her daughter on a Tuesday in April while the trucks hummed in the parking lot and the coffee went cold on the folding table.

"I love you," Sarah said.

"I love you too. Go to sleep."

"I will."

"You won't."

"I will eventually."

"Go save someone, Mom."

Sarah laughed. It was a small laugh, tired, the kind that used the throat but did not reach the chest. "I'll try."

"Try once more," Rebecca said, and the words in her daughter's mouth sounded like something new -- the same phrase, the same syllables, but carried by a different voice, and the carrying changed it, the way a river changes the stones it moves. Rebecca said it lightly, almost joking, and the lightness did not diminish it. The lightness was the beginning of how she would carry it -- not as a burden, not as a command, but as something given, something she could hold without being held by it.

Sarah did not know what her daughter would become. She did not know that Rebecca would go to college intending to study journalism and would change her major in her sophomore year after volunteering at a hospital during a flu season that was not a pandemic but was bad enough, and would apply to medical school, and would match at St. Michael's, and would stand in the same hallway where Sarah had stood and would hear the same words and would carry them the way Sarah had carried them -- not because she was told to but because the carrying was the thing, the doing was the thing, the trying once more was the thing.

She did not know that Margaret Calloway had a twelve-year-old son sitting at a kitchen table right now, doing homework, waiting for a phone call, and that the boy's future was tilting on an axis so small that no mathematics could measure it. She did not know that the school's guidance counselors had been cut in a round of budget reductions, or that the boy was angry in the way that twelve-year-olds are angry when the world has taken something and they do not yet have the language to say what. She did not know that the anger would grow or it would not, and that one of the thousand factors determining which -- one small, invisible, unquantifiable factor -- was that tonight his mother was alive.

She knew none of this. She knew that Margaret Calloway's heart was beating and her daughter was writing an essay about Ida B. Wells and the coffee was cold and her shift was not over.

She set the phone on the table. She sat for another minute in the plastic chair, in the hum of the ventilation and the buzz of the lights, and she let the minute be empty -- sixty-three, tired, her hands resting on her thighs, the N95 creases fading from her cheeks, the work behind her and the work ahead of her and the narrow space between them that was this minute, this chair, this life.

She rinsed the cup. She stood up, and her knee objected, and her back objected, and she overruled them both, and she walked out of the break room and down the hall toward the ward, where the work was waiting, where it was always waiting.

The lights buzzed. The linoleum reflected yellow. Somewhere, a monitor beeped its steady, metered rhythm -- a heart, beating. Somewhere else, a phone rang and was answered. Somewhere else, a twelve-year-old boy sat at a kitchen table and did not know that his mother was alive because a thirty-one-year-old doctor had listened to a sixty-three-year-old woman tell a story about a night in 1985 when she had tried once more.

The chain held. Sarah did not see it. She did not need to.

She went back to work.
