# Chapter 18: Pandemic

**New York City -- March-April 2020**

---

The call came at 6:14 a.m. on a Tuesday, and Cassiel was already awake because she had not slept, and she answered because the phone was in her hand, and the phone was in her hand because she had been reading case files since midnight, scrolling through them in the dark of her studio apartment in Queens with the screen brightness turned down so the light wouldn't bother the neighbors, though the neighbors were also awake, because everyone was awake now, the whole city humming with the low-frequency insomnia of eight million people who had been told to stay inside and wait for something none of them could see.

"It's Gabriel. We have a problem."

"We have several."

"We have a new one. Northeast Regional just pushed the March assignments. You're looking at forty-seven cases."

She pulled the phone from her ear. Looked at the number on the screen, as though the digits might rearrange themselves into something she could process. Put the phone back.

"Say that again."

"Forty-seven simultaneous margin cases. All active. All in the Queens-Brooklyn corridor." A pause. She could hear him breathing -- the slightly labored quality that had been there for months, that she had noticed and filed under *Gabriel is tired, Gabriel is always tired, Gabriel has been tired since 1945.* "Cassiel, I know what that number sounds like."

"It sounds like a mistake."

"It's not a mistake. Azrael has sixty-three. Raphael has thirty-one. Sariel has twenty-eight. The system isn't built for this and the system is what we have."

She sat on the floor of her apartment with her back against the wall and her knees drawn up and the phone warm against her ear. The apartment was spare -- mattress on the floor, kettle, two mugs, a plant she'd bought in 2014 and never named. The plant had died in February. She'd noticed last week. She had not removed it.

"Forty-seven," she said.

"Forty-seven. I'm sorry. I know it's not enough to say that."

"Then don't say it. Send the files."

He sent the files. She read them on her phone because her laptop had frozen three days ago under the weight of simultaneous downloads from the Regional Office, and she hadn't had time to restart it, hadn't had time to do anything that wasn't reading or walking or whispering, the three acts that constituted her entire professional existence. She read them sitting on the floor with the dead plant in her peripheral vision, and each file was a life, and each life was tilting.

Case 7: A nurse at Elmhurst Hospital, thirty-four years old, two children, working twelve-hour shifts in a converted hallway. She had told her husband last night that she wasn't sure she could go back. The husband had said he understood. The nurse had heard: *Then don't.* The margin was narrow -- one more shift and she'd either find the thing that kept her going or she'd walk out, and the three patients she was scheduled to monitor would be transferred to an already-overwhelmed colleague, and one of them would code during the handoff, and the colleague would miss it because she was monitoring someone else, and the one who coded would die. A thirty-year-old father. His daughter was four.

Case 19: A teenager in the Bronx, fifteen, quarantined in a two-bedroom apartment with a mother who worked nights at a warehouse and a stepfather who drank. The teenager had been texting a friend about wanting to die. The texts had become more specific over the past week. The crisis hotline was overwhelmed -- average hold time: forty-seven minutes. The teenager would not hold for forty-seven minutes. The margin was tonight.

Case 31: An elderly man in Brooklyn, seventy-eight, widower, diabetic, living alone. He had a cough that had been worsening for three days. He had not called 911 because he did not want to take a bed from someone younger. He was in his kitchen, drinking tea, deciding whether to call his daughter in Ohio or to simply wait and see. His oxygen saturation was eighty-four percent. He did not own a pulse oximeter. He did not know the number. He just knew that the stairs were harder today, and that the kitchen felt farther from the bedroom than it had yesterday, and that the tea tasted like nothing at all.

Case 38: A grocery store worker in Astoria, twenty-two, undocumented, working without a mask because the store didn't provide them and he couldn't afford his own and he couldn't stop working because his family depended on his paycheck, and the margin was not a single dramatic choice but the slow accumulation of mornings -- get up, go to work, stand behind the register, breathe the same air as three hundred strangers, go home, lie awake wondering if today was the day.

She read all forty-seven. It took four hours. When she finished she sat in the silence and tried to prioritize and could not, because the cases did not lend themselves to hierarchy. They were all urgent. They were all now. They were all someone's one life.

She had been in service for 222 years. She had never seen anything like this.

---

Across the river, in a hospital that smelled of hand sanitizer and the chemical residue of industrial laundry, Dr. Sarah Morrison stood at the nurses' station on the seventh floor and drank cold coffee and felt the floor vibrate beneath her feet.

The vibration was new. She'd noticed it three days ago -- a faint, persistent tremor in the linoleum, as though the building's infrastructure were processing more than it had been designed to hold. The seventh floor had been converted to a COVID ward six days prior. They'd sealed the stairwells with plastic sheeting. They'd set up PPE stations at every entry point -- boxes of N95 masks with elastic straps that left red welts across the forehead, face shields that fogged with every exhalation, yellow gowns that rustled and smelled of the chemical that laundering never quite removed. They'd turned the conference room into an overflow ward. They'd turned the break room into an overflow ward. They'd turned the storage closet where Sarah had once gone to cry after losing a patient in 1991 into a space for two more ventilators.

She was sixty-three. She was Chief of Medicine. She was on hour forty of her third consecutive shift, and the word "shift" had lost its meaning because shifts implied endings, and endings required someone to relieve you, and the residents were breaking, and two nurses had quit yesterday -- not dramatically, just failed to return -- and their absences had been absorbed the way all absences were being absorbed, silently, by the people who remained.

"Dr. Morrison."

James Park, the fourth-year fellow. Crossed straps on his N95, the configuration he'd devised because the standard one pressed against a scar behind his left ear. He was thirty-one and carried himself with the composure of someone who had decided, at some point in the past week, that composure was a medical instrument.

"What do we have?"

"Ventilator shortage. We're down to two available. Four patients in the ER need them." He held the clipboard close to his chest, as though protecting it. "And Mrs. Delgado in room three is declining. Sats dropped to eighty-one overnight. She's been on the vent eleven days."

Sarah wrote the numbers on the whiteboard. She wrote them because writing gave her hands something to do, and because the numbers, for all their cruelty, were concrete. They could be measured and compared and arranged into hierarchies that, if not fair, were at least transparent.

"Gather the residents," she said. "We're going to talk about triage."

They gathered. Eight of them, faces marked by the geometric impressions of N95s they'd been wearing for hours, dark circles that looked structural, as though exhaustion had been built into the architecture of their skulls. Sarah stood at the whiteboard with the dry-erase marker and looked at them and thought: *They are younger than I was when Rosa Chen's heart stopped. They are standing in the same hospital. They are learning the same lesson.*

"The math is impossible," she said. "Two ventilators. Four patients who need them. I'm not going to pretend there's a formula that makes this right. There isn't. But here's what I want you to carry." She set the marker down. "You never know what a life might do. That's not optimism. Optimism is a feeling, and feelings don't survive weeks like this. It's uncertainty. It's the not-knowing. When you're standing at a bed and the numbers say stop, remember that the numbers don't know what happens after. The numbers don't know who goes home and what they say to their children and what those children become."

She picked the marker back up.

"So when you can -- when there's anything left to try -- always try once more."

James looked at her. Above the crossed straps, his eyes held something she recognized: the expression of a person being given a frame for what they already felt.

The angel support group met on Thursday nights. It had met on Thursday nights for eleven years, ever since Gabriel had created it -- unauthorized, unlogged, technically a violation of the Non-Fraternization Protocols that prohibited field angels from congregating outside official channels. Gabriel had created it because the protocols were written by angels who had never worked the field, and because field angels were burning out at rates the protocols did not acknowledge, and because Gabriel, for all his bureaucratic instincts, understood that the system's most critical vulnerability was not in its procedures but in the beings who carried them out.

The group met on Zoom now. This was Gabriel's concession to the times, delivered with the mix of competence and bewilderment that characterized his relationship with technology -- a being who had announced the birth of prophets and decoded divine visions was now sharing his screen and asking if everyone could see his PowerPoint. There was no PowerPoint. He just said it every week out of habit, and no one corrected him, because the small absurdities had become a kind of liturgy.

Cassiel joined from a hospital parking lot in Elmhurst. She sat in a borrowed folding chair between an ambulance and a delivery truck, her phone propped against her knee. The air smelled of diesel and hand sanitizer and something else -- something atmospheric, the collective exhalation of a city breathing through cloth.

"I'll call roll," Gabriel said. His face on screen was drawn. He was 232 years old and he looked it -- not physically, because angels aged in the eyes, where something behind them had been dimming for months, as if someone were turning down a dial that had finally reached the lowest point of its range. "Cassiel."

"Here."

"Raphael."

"Here. I'm in --" A rustling. Raphael was walking. He was always walking. "Sunset Park. Mutual aid delivery. Someone started a neighborhood food drive and it's -- listen, there are beautiful things happening. People are bringing groceries to strangers. I saw a woman leave her entire pantry on a folding table outside her building with a sign that said TAKE WHAT YOU NEED. In English and Spanish. And someone added Mandarin with a Sharpie."

"Raphael," Gabriel said.

"I'm just saying. The mutual aid networks. Humans helping each other without being told to. Without intervention, without threshold assignments, without us. That's --"

"Raphael. How many cases are you running?"

A pause. "Thirty-one."

"How many have you lost?"

A longer pause. "Four."

Gabriel nodded. His face on screen did not change, but the nod carried weight -- the acknowledgment of a number that, in any prior year, would have triggered a formal review and in 2020 was simply Tuesday.

"Azrael."

Azrael's camera was off. His voice, when it came, was flat and stripped of everything except the words, the verbal equivalent of a room emptied of furniture.

"Here."

"Report?"

"Sixty-three cases. Twenty-two resolved. Fourteen failures. Twenty-seven active."

"Sixty-three?" Raphael's voice, sharp now, the optimism cracked. "Since when?"

"Since the system decided to assign me every death-adjacent case in the tristate area. I'm the Angel of Death, Raphael. What did you think was going to happen during a plague."

Silence. The particular silence of people who had known each other for decades and had used up every way to say what they were feeling. Cassiel watched the grid of faces -- Gabriel's drawn and still, Raphael's turned half away, two field angels she knew by name but not well, their screens lit with the pale glow of rooms she couldn't see. And Azrael's black square. Camera off. Voice disembodied. As if he had already begun to disappear.

"The mutual aid networks," Raphael said again, quieter, testing whether the words still held.

"Look at mutual aid networks," Azrael said. "Look at mass death. Where's the plan, Gabriel? Where's the protocol for a plague that produces a thousand threshold cases a day? Where's the memo from the Sixth Heaven explaining how we're supposed to work sixty-three cases with the same resources we had for six?"

Gabriel said nothing for a moment. The screen flickered. Somewhere in his feed, Cassiel could hear a washing machine -- he was still in the office above the laundromat in Astoria, the office that smelled of detergent and old paper and the despair of middle management.

"I can't process this many," Gabriel said.

His voice was very quiet.

"The system isn't designed for pandemic. I've been in service 232 years. I've seen cholera. I've seen influenza. I've never seen -- the volume is --"

He stopped. On screen, his hands moved to his face. He pressed his fingertips against his closed eyes and held them there, and no one spoke, because there was nothing to say to the sound of a man who had spent his career maintaining the architecture of hope admitting that the architecture was not enough.

It was the first time any of them had heard Gabriel admit limitation. It hung in the air the way a crack in a wall hangs -- visible, structural, the kind of thing that once you see it you cannot unsee.

"Maintain protocol," Gabriel said finally. His hands came down. His face was the same. His voice was the same. The words were someone else's.

---

The Emergency Council session convened at the Sixth Heaven on a Wednesday. The chamber was vast, cold, the same oak and stone that had housed deliberations for millennia. Metatron presided. His voice, when he spoke, had the quality of a bell struck once and left to resonate.

"The current crisis does not require a departure from established procedure. It requires faithful execution of established procedure at increased scale."

Sandalphon raised his hand before speaking. He always raised his hand. A human gesture no other Council member used, a deliberate reminder of his mortal origin.

"With respect, Chancellor, the scale *is* the departure. Field agents are carrying forty, fifty, sixty cases simultaneously. The protocols were designed for caseloads of four to six. We are not asking for a new plan. We are asking for coordination rights during pandemic-level events -- permission for field agents to communicate freely, share intelligence, triage collectively rather than in isolation."

"Coordination introduces variables the plan has not accounted for," Metatron said. The words sounded like facts of nature rather than opinions. "Field agents are compromised by proximity to the crisis. Collective decision-making under emotional duress produces suboptimal outcomes. The protocols exist precisely to prevent this."

"The protocols exist to serve the mission," Sandalphon said. "When they stop serving the mission, they serve themselves."

Metatron looked at him. The look was long and contained within it the entire architecture of a disagreement that was older than most angels in the room -- two beings who had once been human, one who had kept that memory, one who had shed it.

"We will vote," Metatron said. "The proposal to authorize expanded coordination during pandemic-level events."

The vote was 4-3. Against. Metatron, Raguel, Jophiel, and one other voted to maintain the existing framework. Sandalphon, Gabriel, and one Reformation ally voted in favor. Haniel passed a written note to the clerk -- it said nothing about coordination. It said: *The field is breaking. You will see it in the numbers.* The note was filed. It was not acted upon.

Gabriel walked out of the Sixth Heaven and did not speak to anyone for two days. When he came back to the office above the laundromat, he opened his laptop and typed a single line in a file no one else could see: *The pattern is accelerating.*

He did not know what it meant yet. He would spend the next five years finding out. He had five years left.

---

Two hundred angels resigned that spring.

The number arrived in a memo from the Regional Office -- a single paragraph, unsigned, the bureaucratic equivalent of a whisper. *Please be advised that 200 field operatives have submitted voluntary separation requests effective immediately. Remaining operatives are instructed to absorb reassigned cases per standard reallocation protocol.*

Absorb. As if the cases were liquid and the angels were sponges and there were a physical law governing how much suffering a being could hold before it saturated and began to leak.

Cassiel read the memo on her phone while standing in the frozen foods aisle of a Key Food on Steinway Street, watching Case 38 -- the grocery worker, the twenty-two-year-old -- stack cartons of orange juice into a refrigerated case. His hands moved with the mechanical precision of someone who had stopped thinking about what he was doing and was simply doing it, the body on autopilot while the mind went somewhere quieter, somewhere the air was not shared.

She read the number and felt something settle inside her, a weight taking up residence in the space behind her sternum. Two hundred. Not the newest recruits, the ones who hadn't yet learned how to carry the work. Not the oldest, the ones who had been carrying it so long they'd forgotten what it felt like to set it down. The ones in between.

Azrael told her later, on a call she didn't remember initiating. She'd called him because she needed to say the number to someone who would not flinch from it, and Azrael was the only angel she knew who treated numbers the way they deserved -- not as abstractions but as evidence.

"I've been tracking the separations," he said. His voice was the same flat instrument it always was, the tone that communicated everything by communicating nothing. "The pattern is non-random."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean it's not distributed evenly across service records. It's concentrated. Field agents with fifty to one hundred years of experience. The most effective caseload range. The ones who've been through enough to be good at this but not enough to be numb to it."

Cassiel was quiet. She was standing on a street corner in Jackson Heights, watching the 7 train rattle overhead, the sound so familiar it had become a kind of silence.

"The most experienced," Azrael said. "The most effective. The most irreplaceable. If you wanted to design an attrition pattern that would do maximum damage to field operations, this is what it would look like."

"You think someone designed it?"

A long pause. She heard his pen on paper, the scratch of it, the sound that accompanied every thought Azrael had.

"I think despair during a pandemic is not unusual," he said. "I think the *concentration* of that despair -- aimed at a specific band of agents, the ones most likely to break, the ones whose departure would cause the most cascading failures -- is worth noting." Another scratch of the pen. "I'm noting it."

"In your notebook."

"In my notebook. Entry eleven thousand, four hundred and twelve. Filed under patterns I cannot explain and do not like."

He hung up. Cassiel stood on the corner and watched the train disappear toward Manhattan, its lit windows sliding through the dark like a sentence being read from left to right.

The two hundred who left. She thought about them in the spaces between cases. Some became human permanently -- surrendered their commissions, shed whatever it was that made them more than mortal, and walked into the ordinary current of a life that would eventually end. Some simply vanished. They walked away from their last assignment and did not report back, did not file paperwork, did not log off the system. They became gaps in the roster, empty chairs in the office above the laundromat, names that no one said aloud because saying them meant acknowledging that the thing holding the system together was not protocol or faith or divine mandate but habit, and habit could be broken.

---

She worked the cases.

She sat in hospital parking lots and bus shelters and the plastic chairs of laundromats, doing what she had done for 222 years: whispering. She sat beside the nurse at Elmhurst during a break and said something small and specific about the three patients waiting for her -- *the one in room four, the father, his daughter drew him a picture* -- and the nurse went back inside. She texted a phone number to the fifteen-year-old's friend, not the overwhelmed hotline but a direct line, a counselor she knew who would answer on the first ring. She called the elderly man's daughter in Ohio, pretending to be a neighbor, and said: *Your father doesn't sound right. You should call him.* The daughter called. The father went to the hospital. He lived.

She lost twelve.

The nurse's husband convinced her to stay home. She stayed for one day, then two, and on the third day the colleague who had taken her patients coded two of them in the same hour and one died -- the thirty-year-old father. His daughter waited outside the hospital with her grandmother, wearing a mask made from a folded bandana. Cassiel stood across the street and watched them and could not go closer because the margin had closed and the case was resolved and the resolution was failure, and failure did not come with a protocol for what to do next.

She lost the elderly man's neighbor. She lost a paramedic who wasn't on her caseload -- she found him sitting on a curb at two in the morning in Long Island City, still in his uniform, staring at the street, and she sat beside him and said the things she knew how to say, but he was past whispering, past the narrow band of intervention that angels were permitted, and three days later his roommate found him in the bathroom. She lost a woman in her forties who had been managing fine -- working from home, exercising, calling her mother every day -- and then one afternoon stopped managing fine, stopped in the way that was invisible from the outside, the emails continuing, the calls continuing, but something inside gone quiet. Cassiel felt it the way she always felt it, the particular frequency of a soul approaching its edge, and she couldn't reach her in time.

Twelve lost. Twenty-eight saved. Seven undecided, still in the margin, still tilting, their files open on her phone like browser tabs she couldn't bring herself to close.

She stopped sleeping. Angels didn't need to sleep, but Cassiel usually did -- four hours a night, a concession to the body she inhabited and the mind inside it. She stopped in the second week of April and did not start again for six weeks. She stopped eating. Angels didn't need to eat, but she usually did -- toast in the mornings, soup from the place on Ditmars Boulevard that knew her order. She had eaten for comfort, for the small human pleasure of warmth and ritual. The ritual felt obscene now, when the people on her caseload were dying for lack of ventilators and the people delivering her soup were risking their lives to bring it.

She moved through the city like something the wind had loosened. Phone and charger and jacket. Sleeping nowhere. Eating nothing. Going where the cases took her.

---

At St. Michael's Hospital, on the seventh floor that had once been medical-surgical and was now a machine for keeping people alive, James Park ran a code on a seventy-two-year-old woman named Margaret Calloway.

She had arrived that afternoon. COVID pneumonia, nine days symptomatic, oxygen saturation dropping. Her daughter had driven her from a house in Ozone Park and left her at the ER entrance because visitors were not allowed, had watched through the glass doors as her mother was taken inside, and had driven home to wait.

By four o'clock, Margaret was coding.

James had started compressions. His hands stacked on her sternum, his body moving with the controlled, rhythmic force of someone who had been trained well and who brought to the act of pressing on a stranger's chest the full weight of his attention, as if each compression were not routine but singular.

"V-fib," said the nurse. "Three minutes."

"Charge to two hundred."

The defibrillator whined. The shock. The body's jump. The monitor: artifact, then fibrillation. Nothing.

"Resume. Epi, one milligram."

Six minutes. Another shock. Nothing. The heart shaking instead of pumping, a muscle that had lost the ability to organize itself. Sarah stood in the doorway. She did not take over. James was running the code well, and the attending's role when the fellow was competent was to watch and intervene only when intervention was necessary.

Ten minutes. Twelve. The nurse's voice had gone neutral, the professional flatness that Cassiel recognized from every hospital she had ever worked in, the tone that said: *We have been at this a long time.*

James looked at Sarah. She knew what he was seeing: an attending in the doorway, the Chief of Medicine, with the authority to call it. He was looking not for permission to stop but to be told to stop, because stopping on your own was a different act than being told.

"One more round," James said. "Charge to three-sixty. Push another epi."

The nurse looked at Sarah. The look was the same one a different nurse had given her in 1985, in a room three floors below this one. *Is this the young doctor who doesn't know when to stop?*

Sarah said nothing. She let James make the call. Because the story of Rosa Chen was not about Sarah. It was about the next person who heard it, and the person after that, an inheritance passed down not through blood but through the act of standing in a room where someone was dying and choosing to try once more.

"Clear."

The shock. The body. The monitor.

A rhythm. Not fibrillation. Not the flat line. Something tentative, irregular, feeling its way back -- the same uncertain, groping quality of a heart waking from a deep sleep, not yet sure of the room it had woken into.

"Sinus," the nurse said. "Rate of forty-eight. Fifty. Fifty-two."

James took his hands off Margaret's chest and stepped back. His arms were shaking. Above the mask, his eyes were wet.

Margaret Calloway, seventy-two years old, mother of four. She would survive this disease and this night. She would go home to Ozone Park. Her youngest son was twelve, a boy who attended a school where the guidance counselors had been cut two years ago -- cut by a budget that Thomas Reed had once voted to slash. The boy was angry and alone and moving toward something terrible. Margaret's survival would not prevent what was coming. But it would give the boy a mother to come home to when the terrible thing was done, a mother who would not let him disappear into the machinery the way his generation disappeared into things -- into screens, into silence, into the long corridors of a system built to process rather than to hold.

Sarah did not know this. James did not know this. Neither of them knew that the woman whose heart they had restarted was a thread in a pattern they could not see, that her survival mattered in ways the math of triage could not calculate, that the sentence *always try once more* had just, for the hundredth time in thirty-five years, produced a consequence that would not be visible for years.

They knew only that Margaret Calloway was alive. They knew that they had done their work. They went on to the next patient.

April 14. Three in the morning. Cassiel sat in her apartment in Queens.

She had not been here in eleven days. The apartment was the same -- mattress, kettle, two mugs, dead plant, the faint hum of the refrigerator, the particular silence of a space that existed primarily as a container for absence. She had come back because she had run out of places to go. She had worked a case in Astoria until midnight and walked east until the walking stopped, and the walking had stopped here, at her own door, the key turning in the lock with the easy muscle memory of a gesture she had made ten thousand times.

She sat on the floor. Her phone was on the carpet in front of her, the screen showing forty-seven case files, of which twelve were closed and marked FAILED, and twenty-eight were closed and marked RESOLVED, and seven were still open, still active, still tilting. She looked at the seven. She thought about the twelve. She thought about the nurse's daughter waiting outside Elmhurst with a bandana over her face. She thought about the paramedic's roommate. She thought about the woman in her forties who had stopped managing fine.

She thought about the two hundred who had left.

Her phone was in her hand. She opened the contacts. She scrolled to the Regional Office number -- the line you called to file a voluntary separation request. She knew the number because she had memorized it in 2001, after September 11, when Gabriel had called at three in the morning and she had said *How do we keep doing this?* and he had said *We don't keep doing this. We start doing it differently.* She had kept the number the way a person keeps a bottle of pills in the medicine cabinet -- not because they planned to use it, but because knowing it was there provided a specific kind of comfort. An exit. A door that remained, regardless of whether you walked through it.

She looked at the number.

She looked at the seven open cases on her screen. Seven people still alive. Seven people whose lives were tilting on axes she could not see and could not control and could only, in the smallest possible way, attend.

She picked up the phone to dial.

She put it down.

She picked it up.

The phone rang in her hand. Not the Regional Office calling. Not a case alert. A personal call. Gabriel's name on the screen, the small grey letters that had appeared there hundreds of times over the decades, the most familiar notification in her life.

She answered.

"Don't quit tonight," Gabriel said.

His voice was the voice she knew -- the voice of a man who had been on hold with the divine for 232 years and had learned to fill the silence with organizational competence and occasional flashes of something deeper. But there was something underneath it now. Something she had not heard before. A thinness, as though the voice were traveling a longer distance than usual to reach her, as though the signal were degrading.

"How did you know?"

"Because I've been sitting at my desk for four hours with the same number pulled up on my phone. Because I called every field agent in the northeast today and eleven of them didn't answer, and I know what that means, and I know you know what that means, and I know you're sitting in your apartment at three in the morning looking at your case files and thinking about the ones you lost."

She said nothing. Outside, a siren moved south on Steinway Street, the sound rising and falling in the pattern that had become the city's pulse.

"I'm not going to tell you it gets better," Gabriel said. "I don't know if it gets better. I don't know if the system works. I don't know if the Council is right or Sandalphon is right or Azrael is right or if any of us are right about anything. I have been doing this for 232 years and I do not know."

"Then what do you know?"

A pause. She could hear the washing machine in the background. The detergent smell came to her through memory -- she had been in that office so many times that the sound of the laundromat was enough to conjure it, the warmth and the clean chemical scent and the stacks of files on his desk and the three phones and the coffee cup, always half-empty, always lukewarm.

"I know you have seven open cases," he said. "And I know that if you resign tonight, those seven cases get redistributed to agents who are already carrying thirty or forty of their own. And I know that the person who has your job tomorrow will not be as good at it as you are, because no one is as good at it as you are, and I am including myself in that assessment, and you know I don't say things I don't mean."

"Gabriel --"

"Quit tomorrow. If you still want to. Quit tomorrow. Just not tonight."

She sat on the floor of her apartment with the phone against her ear and the seven case files glowing on the screen in front of her. The siren faded. The refrigerator hummed. The dead plant cast a small shadow on the wall.

"Okay," she said.

"Okay?"

"Not tonight."

"Not tonight."

A silence. Not the empty kind. The kind that exists between two people who have known each other for decades and have arrived at a place where the words have been used up but the connection has not.

"Gabriel," she said.

"Yeah."

"Are you all right?"

Another pause. Longer than the first.

"I'm at my desk," he said. "I'm doing the work. Look, I need to make four more calls tonight. Go to sleep, Cassiel."

"I don't sleep."

"I know you don't sleep. Go not-sleep, then. And check your cases in the morning."

"I'll check them now."

"Check them in the morning." His voice had the quality of someone who was smiling without the energy to smile, the ghost of warmth in a voice that was running on the last of its reserves. "That's an order from your extremely tired and arguably ineffective regional supervisor."

She almost laughed. She was not the kind of person who laughed easily, but Gabriel had always been the exception, the one who could find the absurd seam in the worst moment and pull at it until something gave. She didn't laugh. But her mouth moved, and the movement was enough.

"Good night, Gabriel."

"Good night."

He hung up. She sat on the floor. The phone was warm in her hand. The apartment was dark except for the glow of the screen and the faint orange light that came through the window from the street, the particular amber of sodium lamps that she had been seeing for decades and that had, without her noticing, become the color of home.

She did not quit.

She did not sleep.

She did not know that Gabriel, sitting at his desk in the office above the laundromat with four more calls to make and a heart that had been working for 232 years without rest, was already dying. Not tonight. Not this year. But the organ that powered him -- whatever angels had in the place where humans had hearts, the thing that kept the signal transmitting and the voice steady and the hands turning the pages of case files at three in the morning -- was failing. Five years from now, he would be found at that same desk, in that same chair, with his reading glasses pushed up onto his forehead and a coffee cup at his elbow and a final note that said *The pattern is accelerating. Tell them.*

She did not know this. She would not know it until the morning she found him there, and the knowing would unmake something in her that she did not yet understand she had built, and the unmaking would be the beginning of something else, something she could not yet name.

But that was five years from now.

Tonight, she sat on the floor of her apartment in Queens. She picked up her phone. She opened the seven case files. She read them again -- not for the information, which she had memorized, but for the act of reading, the ritual of attention, the insistence that these lives were worth the minutes it took to hold them in her mind.

Outside, the city was quiet in the way it had been quiet for weeks -- not silent, because New York was never silent, but muted, the usual roar reduced to sirens and wind and the distant sound of the 7 train running its route through a city that had forgotten what normal meant. The refrigerated trucks hummed in hospital parking lots across the five boroughs. The screens glowed in apartment windows. The nurses changed shifts. The ventilators breathed for the people who could not breathe for themselves.

And somewhere in an office above a laundromat, a 232-year-old administrator picked up his phone and dialed the next number, because there were four more calls to make and the night was not done and the work was the work, and the work was all he had ever known how to offer against the darkness, and the offering had always been insufficient, and he offered it anyway, and the offering was the thing, the only thing, and he knew it, and the knowing was a weight and a gift simultaneously, and he carried both.

The pattern held. Or it didn't. The margin cases tilted. Or they didn't. The system worked, or the system was broken, or the system was being broken by something none of them could see.

Cassiel read the files. Gabriel made his calls. Sarah washed her hands between patients. James checked Margaret Calloway's vitals. Azrael wrote in his notebook. The trucks hummed. The city breathed.

The night continued, the way nights do -- one hour after the next, each one measured and finite and containing within it more than any record could hold.
