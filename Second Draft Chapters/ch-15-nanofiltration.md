# Chapter 15: Nanofiltration

**October 2017 --- New York City**

---

The question had been building in him for forty-five minutes.

Marcus Chen sat in the seventh row of the lecture hall, which was not the seventh row he had wanted --- he had wanted the third, close enough to read the slide text without squinting through the glasses he had bought at a drugstore for nine dollars because his prescription pair had snapped at the bridge last month and he could not afford to replace them. But the third row was full by the time he arrived, and the fifth row was full, and by the seventh row Marcus had stopped caring about the row because the woman at the podium was saying something about biomimetic membrane architectures that made the hairs on his forearms stand up.

The conference was small. Three days of presentations in the engineering building at Columbia, funded --- as the program noted in a footnote Marcus had barely registered --- by a pharmaceutical company called Tanaka-Voss, whose logo appeared on the name badges and the free pens and the canvas tote bags that Marcus had taken two of because they were sturdy and he needed grocery bags. The Materials Science and Environmental Applications Symposium, Fall 2017. Two hundred attendees, most of them graduate students and postdocs. Marcus was one of four undergraduates, and the only one presenting a poster instead of just attending. His poster was rolled in a cardboard tube under his seat, and the tube was slightly damp from the rain he had walked through to get here from the subway, and the poster inside had a crease in it that ran diagonally through his best SEM micrograph, and he had been trying not to think about the crease for three hours.

The woman at the podium was Amira Hassan, third-year PhD candidate, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The slide behind her showed a schematic of an aquaporin channel --- the biological water transport protein that could pass water molecules in single file while rejecting virtually everything else. Marcus had read about aquaporins. He had read about them the way some people read about extinct species or distant galaxies: with fascination for something he believed he would never touch. The biology was elegant. The engineering was impossible. You could not build an aquaporin in a lab at any scale that mattered.

But Amira Hassan was not talking about building aquaporins. She was talking about building things that worked like aquaporins --- synthetic analogs, carbon nanotube channels, peptide-based architectures that mimicked the selectivity of the biological system without requiring the biology. She was talking about it with the kind of specificity that told Marcus she was not reciting a literature review. She was building them.

"The challenge," she said, advancing to a slide showing permeability data, "is that current synthetic channels achieve selectivity or throughput, but not both simultaneously. We're seeing rejection rates of ninety-plus percent for divalent ions, which is good, but the water flux drops to levels that make the system impractical for gravity-fed deployment. You'd need a pump. And if you need a pump, you need power, and if you need power, you've just priced your system out of the communities that need it most."

Marcus's hands were on his knees. His right knee was bouncing. The question was in his throat now, pressing against the inside of his teeth, and he was aware that asking it would mean drawing attention to himself in a room full of people who were older and more credentialed and whose posters did not have creases in them, and he was also aware that not asking it was not an option, because the question was the reason he had taken the subway from Stony Brook to Columbia this morning, even though the round-trip fare was money he did not have and the conference registration fee had been waived only because he had emailed the organizers three times and then shown up at the department office and explained, with a precision that embarrassed him, that his research was relevant and his bank account was not.

Amira was wrapping up. She clicked to her final slide --- future directions, collaboration opportunities, a list of references Marcus had already read. The moderator opened the floor.

Marcus's hand went up.

It went up before the moderator finished speaking, before the room's attention had fully shifted from the podium to the audience, and Marcus was aware of the speed of it --- aware that his arm was already in the air while the other hands were still forming their questions --- and he did not care. His hand went up and stayed up, and the moderator, a silver-haired woman from MIT who had been running these sessions with the bored efficiency of someone managing traffic, looked at him and paused. She paused because Marcus was visibly the youngest person in the room, and because his conference badge said UNDERGRADUATE PRESENTER in a font size smaller than the graduate students', and because his hand was the first one up and it was not wavering.

"Yes," the moderator said. "You."

Marcus stood. He did this without deciding to --- his body simply brought him to his feet, the way it had once brought him thrashing to the surface of a public pool in Brooklyn when he was eight years old. He had nearly drowned that day. A boy he never saw again had pulled him out. He did not think about this now. He never thought about it consciously. But something about the motion was the same --- the upward push, the instinct to break the surface, the need to breathe.

"Your channel analogs," he said. "The peptide-based ones. What rejection rates are you seeing with trivalent arsenic versus pentavalent?"

A small ripple went through the room --- the kind of ripple that happens when someone asks a question that is either very good or very stupid, and the audience has not yet determined which. Amira Hassan, at the podium, tilted her head. She looked at Marcus the way a person looks at a sound they did not expect to hear.

"I'm not specifically testing for arsenic species," she said. "My work is on channel selectivity broadly. Why?"

"Because arsenic speciation determines removal viability in low-resource contexts. Pentavalent arsenic, arsenate, is charged at neutral pH, so any membrane with decent electrostatic repulsion will reject it. The problem is trivalent --- arsenite. It's uncharged below pH nine-point-two, which means your Donnan exclusion falls apart. Standard nanofiltration membranes can hit eighty, maybe eighty-five percent rejection on arsenite, but only with pre-oxidation, and pre-oxidation requires chemical dosing, and chemical dosing requires infrastructure that doesn't exist in the Ganges-Brahmaputra floodplain. So the question is whether your channel analogs --- the peptide architectures specifically --- could achieve steric rejection of uncharged arsenite at a molecular weight cutoff low enough to be practical."

The room was quiet. Marcus was aware that he had been talking for longer than a question should take, and that his hands were doing the thing they did when the subject was water filtration, which was moving in front of him as though shaping something invisible, as though the membrane he was describing existed in the air between his palms and he was showing it to her.

Amira was staring at him. Not at his badge. Not at the row he was sitting in. At him.

"What's your name?" she said.

"Marcus Chen. I'm at Stony Brook. Undergrad."

"Undergrad." She said this flatly, without inflection, the way you'd say the name of a country you didn't expect to hear from. Then she said: "Come find me after the session. I want to see your data."

---

He found her in the hallway outside the lecture hall, leaning against the wall with her arms crossed and her lanyard twisted around one finger. She was taller than him. She wore a flannel shirt over a faded T-shirt that said WATER IS LIFE in block letters, and her sneakers were as worn as his, and this was the first thing he noticed about her that was not scientific, and he filed it in the part of his mind that tracked things he did not have language for.

"Your poster," she said. "Where is it?"

"Station 47. Back wall, by the emergency exit."

"I passed it this morning. I almost didn't stop. The program listed you as an undergrad."

"I am an undergrad."

"I know. That's why I almost didn't stop. Undergrad posters are usually --- supervised."

"My advisor thinks I'm doing soil mechanics."

She looked at him. Then she laughed --- not the polite, professional laugh that people used at conferences, but the real kind, the kind that came from somewhere below the diaphragm and carried surprise in it like a current carries debris, picking up speed. Marcus felt something loosen in his chest. Something that had been tight since six-thirty that morning when he had unrolled his poster on the floor of his dorm room and found the crease running through Figure 3.

"Show me," she said.

They went to the poster. Station 47, back wall of the engineering building's lower-level exhibition space, between the emergency exit and the corridor that led to the restrooms. The poster had the crease. The crease was as visible as it had been at six-thirty that morning, bisecting his SEM micrograph of the polyamide thin-film composite membrane so that the cross-section image looked warped. Marcus had considered reprinting it. He had sixty-two dollars less than it would cost.

Amira stepped close. She read silently, her eyes tracking left to right across the poster with the systematic focus of someone who read data the way other people read novels --- for the story underneath the numbers. She paused at Figure 4, the bar graph showing arsenic species rejection rates at varying transmembrane pressures.

"Eighty-nine percent on trivalent," she said. "Without pre-oxidation."

"Eighty-nine point three. At pH eight."

"How."

"Modified monomer ratio during interfacial polymerization. MPD to TMC, two-point-five to one instead of the standard two to one. The higher MPD concentration gives a denser polyamide network --- more cross-linking, tighter effective pore structure. The trivalent arsenite has to navigate a longer diffusion path through the membrane matrix. I lose about twelve percent on permeability, but the rejection goes up."

"And you figured this out how?"

"Trial and error. I've been running IP reactions since sophomore year. My advisor lets me use the lab on weekends. Mostly I work at night. The lab's empty at night."

Amira made a sound that was not quite a laugh but lived in its neighborhood. "I know about the empty-lab-at-night thing." She pointed at the crease. "This goes right through your best micrograph."

"I know."

"Couldn't afford to reprint?"

"The reprint costs sixty-two dollars. My checking account has fifty-one."

She nodded. She said this with a nod rather than with words, and the nod contained no pity and no performance --- it was the nod of someone who knew what fifty-one dollars in a checking account meant because her own balance was not dramatically different, and who did not consider this information a reason to soften anything.

"Come get coffee," she said. "I want to talk about your monomer ratios."

---

The coffee shop was three blocks from Columbia, on a side street where the rent was still low enough for a place that served drip coffee in ceramic mugs and let students sit for hours. The tables were small and scratched and wobbled if you leaned on them wrong. The coffee tasted like the carafe had not been cleaned since semester started. It was the cheapest thing on the menu. They ordered two smalls.

Marcus sat across from Amira at a table by the window where the October light came through the glass and fell across the napkins she was already drawing on.

"Your approach is good," she said, sketching a cross-section with a ballpoint pen she'd taken from the conference tote bag. "The denser polyamide network, the steric rejection pathway --- it's sound. But you're optimizing within the existing architecture. You're making a better version of the same box."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean this." She drew a series of concentric circles. "My channels. The synthetic analogs. They don't use pressure differentials the way NF membranes do. They use molecular selectivity --- water passes through in single file, everything else is excluded by geometry, not by charge or pressure. The energy requirement drops by an order of magnitude. You wouldn't need a pump. You could run it on gravity."

Marcus pulled the napkin toward him. "But fabrication. You can't manufacture those channels at scale. The self-assembly process is --- "

"Impractical. Currently. Yes." She tapped the pen against the table. "But what if you didn't have to fabricate the channels from scratch? What if you used a dense polymer matrix --- something like your modified TFC --- as the support structure, and embedded the channel analogs during the interfacial polymerization step? A single-step process. Your matrix. My channels."

Marcus looked at her drawing. He looked at his poster, which he could not see from here but which existed in his mind as completely as if it were taped to the wall in front of him. He looked at the place where the two ideas met.

"The monomer ratio would need to be high enough to accommodate channel insertion without disrupting the network," he said. "But if the cross-linking density is sufficient, you could distribute the channels uniformly within the active layer. The polyamide matrix provides mechanical stability. The channels provide selectivity. You'd get both rejection and flux."

"A hybrid architecture."

"That's not a crazy idea."

"It's not a crazy idea," she agreed.

They looked at each other across the table. The napkins between them were covered in diagrams --- her concentric circles, his membrane cross-sections, the place where the two intersected. The coffee was cooling. Neither of them touched it. Outside the window, students walked past in the October afternoon, carrying backpacks and phones, the ordinary traffic of a world that did not know or care about arsenic in groundwater or transmembrane pressure or the forty-three million people in Bangladesh drinking water that was killing them slowly.

The conversation lasted four hours.

They argued about polymer matrices. They agreed about the inadequacy of municipal water treatment across South and Southeast Asia. They argued about gravity-fed systems versus pump-driven, and Marcus said the physics favored pumps and Amira said the economics favored gravity and they were both right, which was the kind of argument that did not end because it could not be won and because neither of them wanted to win it --- they wanted to solve it, which was a different thing, and the difference was what made them keep talking.

They discovered they had both read the Karan and Jiang paper from 2015. They discovered they had both read the WHO technical report on arsenic exposure in the Ganges-Brahmaputra floodplain. They had both dog-eared the same page --- Table 7, the one with mortality rates by arsenic concentration, the one with the numbers that made you put the report down and stare at the wall.

"Forty-three million people," Amira said. She said it the way you say a number you have been carrying for years, a number that has worn a groove in you. "Not because the science doesn't exist. Because the delivery is too expensive for the people who need it."

"The materials cost for a standard NF system is under two dollars per square meter," Marcus said. His hands were moving again, shaping the invisible membrane. "Under two dollars. The failure isn't in the lab. It's between the lab and the village. It's infrastructure. It's funding. It's the gap between knowing how and being able to."

"That gap is the whole problem." Amira set her pen down. She looked at him with an expression Marcus could not have named but would remember for years --- the expression of someone who has been speaking a language no one else speaks and has just heard it spoken back to her. "My family almost lost our house, a few years ago. Zoning issue. Some city council vote that would have displaced half our neighborhood. The vote failed. One politician abstained, apparently. One vote. My parents didn't even know his name."

She shook her head. "I think about that. How one decision by someone you've never met can change everything. And then I think about those forty-three million people, and I think: somewhere there's a material, a membrane, a design that does for them what that one vote did for my family. The leverage exists. We just haven't found it yet."

Marcus was quiet. Something about what she said --- the politician, the abstention, the one vote --- produced a faint resonance in the back of his mind, formless, untraceable. A pattern he could not see. A connection he could not make.

He let it go.

"We should work together someday," he said.

Amira looked at him. The afternoon had thinned into evening without either of them noticing. The coffee shop had emptied and refilled around them. Their mugs had been cold for two hours. The napkins on the table were covered in ink --- equations, diagrams, molecular structures, arrows connecting her work to his in lines that looked, if you did not know better, like the notation for a piece of music.

"Someday," she said. "When we've figured out what we're doing."

"I know what I'm doing."

"You're twenty-one. You're an undergrad. You have a crease in your poster and fifty-one dollars in your checking account."

"Fifty. I bought coffee."

She smiled. Not the professional smile. The other one. "Give me your email. I want to send you some papers on peptide channel architectures. And I want your full monomer ratio dataset --- not the poster version."

Marcus wrote his email on a napkin. His handwriting was small and even, the letters and numbers precisely formed --- the handwriting of a person who had spent years recording lab data in notebooks because he could not afford a digital lab journal subscription. Amira wrote hers beneath it, her handwriting larger, faster, the letters leaning forward as if in a hurry.

They split the bill. Two small drip coffees. Four dollars and thirty cents with tax. Marcus put down two ones and a quarter. Amira covered the rest, and there was no performance in it, no negotiation, just two people doing the math of being broke with the efficiency that broke people develop.

Outside, the October air smelled like wet leaves and city exhaust and the mineral cold that settled over New York in the evenings between summer and winter. They stood on the sidewalk and the streetlights were coming on, one by one, down the block.

"It was good to meet you, Marcus Chen."

"It was good to meet you, Amira Hassan."

They shook hands. Her grip was firm and brief and her palm was calloused in the places where lab work calloused you. She turned east toward the subway. He turned west, the poster tube under his arm, the napkin with her email in his jacket pocket next to a granola bar he had forgotten to eat.

He would not see her again for seven years.

---

The distance was ordinary. Graduate school consumed her; the late stages of undergrad and then his own doctorate consumed him. They exchanged emails for a while --- papers, links, a question about MPD concentrations, a note about a conference in Singapore neither of them could afford to attend. Then the emails thinned, the way correspondence thins when life fills the spaces between intention and action. She finished at Illinois, took a postdoc in California. He stayed at Stony Brook, then transferred to MIT. They read some of the same journals. They attended none of the same conferences. The napkin survived --- folded inside a notebook, moved from one apartment to the next, kept not deliberately but in the way you keep certain things, because some part of you recognizes that it matters even when you cannot say why.

The conversation survived too. Four hours in a cheap coffee shop, the light through the window, the diagrams on napkins. *Your matrix. My channels.* It lived in the back of his mind the way his grandmother's words lived there --- not as plan, not as belief, but as a kind of seed, dormant, waiting for conditions that had not yet arrived.

---

Marcus walked west on 116th Street with the poster tube under his arm and the October cold on his face. The granola bar was still in his pocket. He was not thinking about food. He was thinking about hybrid membrane architectures and peptide channel analogs and the forty-three million people in Bangladesh and the way Amira Hassan's handwriting leaned forward, and the thinking had the quality of a current moving through him, not urgent but directional, as though something inside him had found its orientation and was now pointing toward a place he could not yet see.

He turned south. The blocks changed as he walked --- the university's limestone and iron giving way to the mixed geography of upper Manhattan, bodegas and dry cleaners and a nail salon with its lights still on and a laundromat with its dryers tumbling behind plate glass. He walked without looking up. He was doing math in his head --- not the math of membranes but the math of his life, the calculation of how long it would take to get from here to the place where the work could become real, the place where a prototype became a product became a system became clean water coming out of a tube well in a village where a girl his age was drawing water every morning and drinking something that would shorten her life by twenty years.

He passed a building.

It was unremarkable. Six stories, mixed-use, the kind of converted industrial space that existed all over the outer boroughs --- a garment factory once, probably, the brickwork old and darkened, fire escape rusting on the south face. The lobby had a directory board visible through the glass door, plastic letter tiles, some of them missing. A freight elevator behind a metal gate. The kind of building you walked past a thousand times and never once looked at.

On the third floor, a light was on. A woman named Elena Vasquez, twenty-nine years old, was working in a studio cluttered with scrap metal and broken glass and the failed prototypes of processes she did not understand, shaping them into forms she could not yet name. She had been in the studio since noon. She had not eaten. Her hands were scarred from welding, and she was building something out of discarded materials she had pulled from a dumpster in the alley --- the dumpster that served the upper floors, the floors where labs and small offices operated, the floors that threw away their failures.

On the ground floor, a woman named Keisha Williams, thirty-five years old, was signing in at the security desk for her overnight cleaning shift. She carried a canvas bag with her supplies and a phone that held photographs of her three children. She would ride the freight elevator to the top floor and work her way down, vacuuming and emptying trash and wiping surfaces, moving through the building the way a current moves through a circuit --- connecting things that did not know they were connected, maintaining the space where other people's work happened, invisible and essential.

Marcus Chen walked past the building. He did not look up. He did not see the light on the third floor or the woman signing in at the desk. He was twenty-one years old and thinking about water and he did not know that the building he had just passed would, in seven years, house the lab where he would do the work that mattered most. He did not know that the woman on the third floor would build sculptures from his discarded prototypes. He did not know that the woman at the security desk would clean around his equipment five nights a week for a decade, and that her granddaughter, not yet born, would one day lie on a hospital bed while a doctor descended from the woman Marcus's grandmother had been --- a woman who died saying angels would protect him --- restarted her heart.

Three people on the same block. A scientist. An artist. A mother. Their lives running in parallel, separated by three floors and the ordinary opacity of a city where eight million people occupied the same geography without ever seeing the web that held them together.

None of them knew.

Marcus kept walking. The poster tube bumped against his hip. The napkin with Amira's email was in his pocket. The granola bar was next to it, forgotten. Somewhere behind him, Elena Vasquez bent over her workbench and Keisha Williams stepped into the freight elevator and the building held them both, the way a body holds its organs --- unknowing, necessary, alive.

He walked home through the October dark and for the first time in months the work ahead of him felt less like a weight and more like a direction. The crease in his poster had not stopped Amira Hassan from asking the right question. The fifty dollars in his checking account --- forty-nine now, after the coffee --- would not stop him either. The work was the work. The water was the water. Somewhere in Bangladesh, forty-three million people were waiting, and they did not know they were waiting, and he did not know how to reach them yet, but the distance between what he knew and what they needed had shrunk by exactly the width of a four-hour conversation with a woman in a flannel shirt who understood what he was trying to do.

He went home. He pinned the poster to the wall above his desk, crease and all. He opened his laptop and began to write.
