# Chapter 18: Pandemic

**New York City — March–April 2020**

---

The first case came on a Tuesday. By Thursday there were six. By the following Monday, fourteen. By the end of March, Cassiel had forty-seven active margin cases on her caseload, and the number was still climbing, and the system that was supposed to process them — the intake forms, the assessment protocols, the careful calibration of intervention thresholds that had governed angel operations for two millennia — had collapsed like a building whose foundation had been quietly rotting for years and needed only one hard season to come apart.

She sat on the floor of her studio apartment in Queens and read the case files on her phone. She read them because she couldn't read them on her laptop — the laptop had frozen three days ago, overloaded with the simultaneous downloads from the Northeast Regional Office, and she hadn't had time to restart it. She hadn't had time to do anything that wasn't reading case files. Her apartment, which had always been spare — a mattress on the floor, a kettle, two mugs, a plant she'd bought in 2014 and forgotten to name — was now simply empty. The plant had died sometime in February. She'd noticed last week. She hadn't removed it.

Case 7: A nurse at Elmhurst Hospital, thirty-four years old, two children, working twelve-hour shifts in a converted hallway. She had told her husband last night that she wasn't sure she could go back. The husband had said he understood. The nurse had heard: *Then don't.* The margin was narrow — one more shift and she'd either find the thing that kept her going or she'd walk out and the three patients she was scheduled to monitor would be transferred to an already-overwhelmed colleague, and one of them would code during the handoff, and the colleague would miss it because she was checking on a different patient, and the one who coded would die. A thirty-year-old father of one. His daughter was four.

Case 19: A teenager in the Bronx, fifteen, quarantined in a two-bedroom apartment with a mother who worked nights at a warehouse and a stepfather who drank. The teenager had been texting a friend about wanting to die. The texts had become more specific over the past week. The friend didn't know what to do. The crisis hotline was overwhelmed — average hold time: forty-seven minutes. The teenager would not hold for forty-seven minutes. The margin was tonight.

Case 31: An elderly man in Brooklyn, seventy-eight, widower, diabetic, living alone. He had a cough that had gotten worse over three days. He had not called 911 because he did not want to take a hospital bed from someone younger. He was sitting in his kitchen, drinking tea, deciding whether to call his daughter in Ohio or to simply wait and see. His oxygen saturation was eighty-four percent. He did not own a pulse oximeter. He did not know the number. He just knew that the stairs were harder today, and that the kitchen felt farther from the bedroom than it had yesterday, and that the tea tasted strange.

Case 38: A grocery store worker in Astoria, twenty-two, undocumented, working without a mask because the store didn't provide them and he couldn't afford his own and he couldn't not work because his family depended on his paycheck, and the margin was not a single dramatic choice but the slow accumulation of mornings — get up, go to work, stand behind the register, breathe the same air as three hundred strangers, go home, lie awake wondering if today was the day.

Forty-seven cases. Cassiel read them all. She read them sitting on the floor of her apartment with her back against the wall and her phone growing warm in her hands, scrolling through lives that were fraying at the same speed, in the same way, for the same reason, and the reading took four hours and when she finished she sat in the silence and tried to prioritize and could not, because the cases did not lend themselves to hierarchy. They were all urgent. They were all now. They were all someone's one life.

She had been in service for 235 years. She had never seen anything like this.

The angel support group met on Thursday nights. It had met on Thursday nights for eleven years, ever since Gabriel had created it — unauthorized, unlogged, technically a violation of the Non-Fraternization Protocols that prohibited field angels from congregating outside official channels. Gabriel had created it because the protocols were written by angels who had never worked the field, and because field angels were burning out at rates that the protocols did not acknowledge, and because Gabriel, for all his bureaucratic fastidiousness, understood that the system's greatest vulnerability was not its procedures but the beings who carried them out.

The group met on Zoom now. This was Gabriel's concession to the times, delivered with a mix of competence and bewilderment that characterized everything Gabriel did with technology — a being who had announced the birth of prophets and decoded divine visions was now sharing his screen and asking if everyone could see his PowerPoint. There was no PowerPoint. He just said that every week out of habit, and no one corrected him, because the small absurdities had become a kind of liturgy, a way of marking the fact that they were still here, still meeting, still pretending that normalcy was possible.

Cassiel joined from a hospital parking lot in Elmhurst. She sat in a borrowed folding chair between an ambulance and a delivery truck, her phone propped against her knee. The air smelled of diesel and hand sanitizer and something else — something that had settled over the city in the past weeks, not a smell exactly but an atmospheric presence, the collective exhalation of eight million people breathing through cloth and waiting for something they could not see.

"I'll call roll," Gabriel said. His face on the screen was drawn. He was 237 years old, and he looked it — not physically, because angels aged the way humans didn't, slowly and then not at all, but in the eyes, where the light behind them had dimmed, as if someone had been turning down a dial for months and had finally reached the bottom of its range. "Cassiel."

"Here."

"Raphael."

"Here. I'm in — where am I." A rustling. Raphael was walking. He was always walking. "Sunset Park. Mutual aid delivery. Someone started a neighborhood food drive, it's — listen, there are beautiful things happening. People are bringing groceries to strangers. I saw a woman leave her entire pantry on a folding table outside her building with a sign that said TAKE WHAT YOU NEED. In both English and Spanish. And someone added Mandarin with a Sharpie."

"Raphael," Gabriel said.

"I'm just saying. The mutual aid networks. Humans helping each other without being told to. Without intervention, without margin-case assignments, without us. That's — "

"Raphael. How many cases are you running?"

A pause. "Thirty-one."

"How many have you lost?"

A longer pause. "Four."

Gabriel nodded. His face on the screen did not change, but the nod carried weight — the acknowledgment of a number that, in any prior year, would have been a catastrophe worthy of a formal review and in 2020 was simply Tuesday.

"Azrael."

Azrael's camera was off. His voice, when it came, was flat and stripped of everything except the words themselves, the verbal equivalent of a room that had been emptied of furniture.

"Here."

"Report?"

"Sixty-three cases. Twenty-two resolved. Fourteen failures. Twenty-seven active."

"That's — " Raphael's voice, sharp now, the optimism cracked. "Sixty-three? Since when?"

"Since the system decided to assign me every death-adjacent case in the tristate area. I'm the Angel of Death, Raphael. What did you think was going to happen during a plague."

The silence on the Zoom call was the particular silence of seven people who had known each other for decades and had run out of ways to say what they were feeling. Cassiel watched the grid of faces — Gabriel's drawn and still, Raphael's turned half away from the camera, two other field angels she knew by name but not well, their faces illuminated by the pale light of screens in rooms she couldn't see. And Azrael's black square, the camera off, the voice disembodied, as if he had already begun to disappear.

"The mutual aid networks," Raphael said again, quieter this time, as if testing whether the words still held.

"Look at mutual aid networks," Azrael said. "Look at mass death. Where's the plan, Gabriel? Where's the protocol for a plague that creates a thousand margin cases a day? Where's the memo from the Sixth Heaven explaining how we're supposed to run sixty-three cases with the same resources we had for six?"

Gabriel said nothing for a moment. The screen flickered. Somewhere in the background of his feed, Cassiel could hear the sound of a washing machine — he was still broadcasting from the office above the laundromat in Astoria, the office that smelled of detergent and old paper and the despair of middle management.

"I can't process this many," Gabriel said. His voice was very quiet. "The system isn't designed for pandemic. I've been in service 237 years. I've seen cholera. I've seen influenza. I've never seen — the volume is — I can't — "

He stopped. On the screen, his hands moved to his face. He pressed his fingertips against his closed eyes and held them there, and no one spoke, because there was nothing to say to the sound of a 237-year-old administrator admitting that the architecture he had spent his career maintaining was insufficient for the thing it had been built to withstand.

"Maintain protocol," Gabriel said finally. His hands came down. His face was the same. His voice was the same. The words were someone else's — Metatron's, from the Emergency Council session that had convened and adjourned in the same hour, the session where Sandalphon had proposed allowing angels to exceed case limits and coordinate freely and the vote had failed because the majority of the Council had never worked the field and did not understand what it meant to sit in a hospital parking lot at three in the morning reading case files on a phone, and protocol was their answer to everything, the way silence was the answer of people who did not have better ones.

"Maintain protocol," Gabriel repeated. "That's the guidance. I'm sorry. I know it's not enough. I'm sorry."

Raphael said something about the food drive. Azrael's square went dark. The call ended. Cassiel sat in the parking lot with her phone on her knee and stared at the ambulance parked beside her and did not move for a long time.

Two hundred angels resigned that year. The number arrived in a memo from the Regional Office — a single-paragraph communication, unsigned, the bureaucratic equivalent of a whisper. *Please be advised that 200 field operatives have submitted voluntary separation requests effective immediately. Remaining operatives are instructed to absorb reassigned cases per standard reallocation protocol.*

Absorb. As if the cases were liquid, as if the angels were sponges, as if there were a physical law governing how much suffering a being could hold before it saturated and began to leak. Cassiel read the memo on her phone while standing in the frozen foods aisle of a Key Food on Steinway Street, watching Case 38 — the grocery store worker, the twenty-two-year-old, the one who got up every morning and breathed the same air as three hundred strangers — stack cartons of orange juice into a refrigerated case. His hands moved with the mechanical precision of someone who had stopped thinking about what he was doing and was simply doing it, the body on autopilot while the mind went somewhere else, somewhere quieter, somewhere the air was not shared.

The two hundred who left. Cassiel thought about them sometimes, in the spaces between cases, in the minutes she spent walking from one intervention to the next. Some became human permanently — surrendered their commissions, shed whatever it was that made them more than mortal, and walked into the ordinary current of a life governed by biology and accident and the finite mercy of a body that would eventually stop. Some simply disappeared. They walked away from their last assignment and did not report back, did not file separation paperwork, did not log off the system. They became gaps in the roster, empty chairs in the office above the laundromat, names that no one mentioned because mentioning them meant acknowledging that the thing holding the system together was not protocol or faith or divine mandate but habit, and habit could be broken.

Cassiel stayed.

She stayed because leaving required a decision, and decisions required energy, and energy was a resource she had burned through in the first two weeks of March and had not replenished. She stayed because the cases were there and the cases were people and the people were alive, and as long as they were alive there was a margin, and as long as there was a margin there was work, and as long as there was work she did not have to decide what she was or what she believed or whether any of it mattered. She stayed because she was the Angel of Solitude, and solitude was what she had, and in the calculus of 2020 it had become an asset — she had no one to lose. No partner, no close friend, no angel she saw outside of Thursday calls. Her isolation, which in any other year was a wound, had become a kind of armor. She could not be broken by the loss of someone she loved, because she did not love anyone. She had arranged her existence to make this true, and the arrangement held, and the holding felt like nothing at all.

She worked the cases. She sat in hospital parking lots and bus shelters and the plastic chairs of laundromats, whispering to strangers. She sat next to the nurse at Elmhurst during a break and said something about the three patients waiting for her, something small and specific — *the one in room four, the father, his daughter drew him a picture* — and the nurse went back inside. She texted a phone number to the fifteen-year-old's friend — not the crisis hotline but a direct line, a counselor she knew, someone who would pick up on the first ring. She called the elderly man's daughter in Ohio, pretending to be a neighbor, and said: *Your father doesn't sound right. You should call him.* The daughter called. The father went to the hospital. He lived.

She lost twelve.

The nurse's husband convinced her to stay home. She stayed home for one day, then two, and on the third day the colleague who had taken her patients coded two of them in the same hour and one died — the thirty-year-old father. His daughter waited outside the hospital with her grandmother, wearing a mask made from a folded bandana, and Cassiel stood across the street and watched them and could not go closer, because there was nothing to say, because the margin had closed and the case was resolved and the resolution was failure, and failure did not come with a protocol for what to do next.

She lost the elderly man's neighbor. She lost a paramedic who was not on her caseload — she found him sitting on a curb at two in the morning in Long Island City, still in his uniform, staring at the street, and she sat beside him and said the things she knew how to say, but he was beyond whispering, beyond the narrow band of intervention that angels were permitted, and three days later he did not show up for his shift and his roommate found him in the bathroom. She lost a woman in her forties who had been managing fine, who had been working from home and exercising and calling her mother every day, and then one afternoon stopped managing fine, stopped in the way that was invisible from the outside — the emails continued, the calls continued, the groceries were ordered and received — but something inside had gone quiet, and Cassiel felt it the way she always felt it, the particular frequency of a soul moving toward its edge, and she could not reach her in time.

Twelve lost. Twenty-eight saved. Seven undecided — still in the margin, still tilting, their cases open on Cassiel's phone like tabs in a browser that she could not bring herself to close.

She stopped sleeping. Angels didn't need to sleep, but Cassiel usually did — four hours a night, sometimes five, a concession to the body she inhabited and the mind inside it, both of which functioned better with rest. She stopped in the second week of April and did not start again for six weeks. She stopped eating, too. Angels didn't need to eat, but she usually did — toast in the mornings, soup from the place on Ditmars Boulevard that knew her order, the occasional bodega sandwich eaten on a bench in Astoria Park while watching the barges move on the East River. She had eaten for comfort, for the small human pleasure of taste and warmth and the ritual of sitting down, but comfort was a luxury she could not justify, and the ritual felt obscene when the people on her caseload were dying for lack of ventilators and the people delivering her soup were risking their lives to bring it. She stopped going to her apartment. She carried her phone and a charger and a jacket and moved through the city like something the wind had loosened, going where the cases took her, sleeping nowhere, eating nothing, a body in motion that could not afford to rest because rest meant silence and silence meant thinking and thinking meant confronting the question that sat beneath all the others, the question she had been evading for 235 years: *What is this for?*

She sat in the plastic chairs of hospital waiting rooms, the ones that had been emptied of families because families were not allowed in. She sat on bus stop benches in neighborhoods where the buses still ran, half-empty, the passengers masked and spaced apart, each one sealed inside the private geometry of six feet. She stood in grocery store aisles, watching the workers stock shelves in the early hours, and she whispered — not words, usually, but something adjacent to words, the way she had whispered to Sarah Morrison in 1985, in the waiting room at St. Michael's, a sound that was not a sound, a presence that was not a presence, something that might, if the person was listening, register as the faint, irrational sense that they were not entirely alone.

She was alone. That was the fact of it. She had always been alone — it was her title, her domain, her nature. The Angel of Solitude. The one who watched from the edges. The one who sat in waiting rooms for six hours because no one noticed her, because not being noticed was the point. The isolation that defined her had never been a choice; it was the condition she had been given, the shape of the vessel she inhabited, and for 235 years she had lived inside it the way a person lives inside a body they did not choose — with accommodation, with adaptation, with the occasional flare of resentment that faded into the background hum of what simply was.

But the aloneness in 2020 was different. It was not the solitude of purpose — the angel alone in the field, working her case, isolated by mission. It was the solitude of a city that had turned inward, every door closed, every face masked, every human sealed inside the same terror and unable to reach across it. Cassiel walked through Queens at three in the morning and the streets were empty and the sirens were constant and the windows of the apartments were lit with the blue glow of screens, and behind every screen was a person sitting in the same silence she sat in, and the silence connected them and the silence separated them, and the loneliness was not hers alone but everyone's, a pandemic of solitude laid on top of the other pandemic, and she could not fix either one.

April 14. Three in the morning. She sat on a bench outside Elmhurst Hospital. The parking lot was full of refrigerated trucks. She knew what was in the trucks. Everyone knew what was in the trucks. The trucks hummed. The sound was steady and low, a mechanical drone that existed just below the threshold of attention, the way the fluorescent lights at St. Michael's had buzzed in 1985, the way all the machinery of death buzzed — constant, impersonal, running whether you listened to it or not.

Her phone showed seven open cases. Seven people still in the margin, still alive, still deciding. She read their files again. She had memorized them, but she read them anyway, the way a person reads a prayer — not for the information but for the act of reading, the ritual of attention, the insistence that these lives were worth the minutes it took to hold them in her mind.

Case 12: resolved. The teenager's friend had called the counselor. The teenager was alive.

Case 38: unresolved. The grocery worker was still going to work. Still breathing shared air. Still alive.

Case 44: resolved. The daughter of the man with the four-year-old had drawn another picture. It was taped to the window of their apartment, facing outward, a crayon sun with a face, and beneath it, in a child's handwriting: WE MISS YOU DADDY. The father was dead. The daughter did not know. The picture was for when he came home.

Cassiel closed her phone. She sat on the bench. The refrigerated trucks hummed. The sirens moved through the city in patterns she could almost predict — south on Junction Boulevard, east on Roosevelt, north toward the bridge, the sound rising and falling and rising again, a frequency that had become the city's heartbeat, the rhythm of a body in crisis.

She had been in service for 235 years. She had worked margins in plagues and wars and famines and the long, grinding crises that did not have names, the ones that killed people slowly and individually and without the drama that attracted attention. She had sat in this same parking lot — not literally, but functionally, the same kind of place, the same kind of hour, the same kind of silence — a thousand times. She had always stayed.

She would stay now. Not because she believed it was enough. Not because she believed the system worked, or that the protocol was sound, or that the Council's refusal to let angels coordinate freely was anything other than cowardice dressed in the language of principle. She would stay because the seven people on her phone were alive, and their aliveness was a fact, and facts required witnesses, and she was the Angel of Solitude, and witnessing was the only thing she had ever been any good at.

She stood up from the bench. She put her phone in her pocket. She walked toward the hospital entrance, where the next case was waiting, where the next margin was forming, where the next life was tilting on its axis toward an outcome she could not predict and could not control and could only, in the smallest possible way, attend.

The trucks hummed behind her. The sirens moved through the dark. She went to work.
