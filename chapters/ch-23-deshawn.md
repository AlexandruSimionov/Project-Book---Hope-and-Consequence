# Chapter 23: DeShawn

**October 2024 — Baltimore, Maryland**

---

The shoes were Jordans. Keisha saw them by the door when she came home from the grocery store at nine-forty on a Tuesday, her feet aching through the soles of the Payless flats she'd bought in August, and the first thing she thought was not *where did he get those* but *how long has this been going on*.

The Jordans were white with a red swoosh. Retro 4s. She didn't know the model names but she knew the price — she had stood in Foot Locker with DeShawn last spring while he'd pointed at a pair behind the glass and she'd looked at the tag and said *baby, we can't*, and he'd said *I know, Ma*, and they'd walked out, and neither of them had mentioned it again because there was nothing to say about the distance between wanting and having that they hadn't already said a thousand times.

Now the shoes were by the door. Still clean. The laces still factory-crisp.

She set the groceries on the counter — four bags, store brand everything, the kind of shopping that required an algebra her mother had taught her and that she had never stopped solving: this much for milk, this much for bread, this much for the gas bill, this much for nothing because nothing was what was left after the math was done. She opened the refrigerator and put the cold things away. She moved slowly. She had learned, over seventeen years of raising children in this neighborhood, that speed was the enemy of clarity. You did not run toward the thing you were afraid of. You walked. You looked. You made sure you understood what you were seeing before you opened your mouth.

DeShawn's bedroom door was closed. Music leaked from the edges — something with bass, the thump of it vibrating the thin drywall that separated his room from the hallway. Tiana was at the kitchen table doing homework, her pencil moving in the focused, deliberate way of a fourteen-year-old who had figured out that schoolwork was the quietest room in the house. Jaylen was on the couch, asleep, his ten-year-old body folded into a position that looked uncomfortable and was probably perfect, the remote still in his hand, the television playing a rerun of something with a laugh track.

Keisha covered Jaylen with the blanket from the back of the couch. She turned off the television. She stood for a moment looking at him — his face slack and smooth, the face of a child who still slept like sleeping was easy — and then she turned to Tiana.

"Those shoes by the door."

Tiana didn't look up from her homework. "DeShawn's."

"Since when?"

"I don't know. A week, maybe."

"He say where he got them?"

Now Tiana looked up. Her eyes had the careful, measured quality of a girl who had learned to read rooms the same way Keisha had — by watching, by listening, by understanding that information was a kind of currency and you didn't spend it unless you had to.

"He didn't say."

Keisha nodded. She went to the sink and washed her hands. The water was cold because the hot water heater was doing the thing it did every October, running lukewarm for forty-five seconds and then going ice, a problem the landlord had promised to fix in a timeline that existed only in the landlord's imagination. She dried her hands on the kitchen towel and stood at the counter and did not go to DeShawn's door.

Not yet.

---

The phone appeared three days later.

It was an iPhone — not the newest model, but new enough. DeShawn was sitting on the front steps when she got home from the cleaning job, ten-thirty at night, her back a solid wall of pain from four hours of mopping office floors in a building downtown where the people who worked there earned more in a week than she earned in three months. He was looking at the phone with the soft, lit expression that phones put on faces, the blue light making him look younger than seventeen and older than seventeen at the same time.

"What's that?" she said.

He tilted the screen away. Reflex. "Phone."

"I can see it's a phone. Where'd it come from?"

"Friend let me borrow it."

"What friend?"

"Ma." The word had weight in it. Not disrespect — she would have known disrespect. This was something else. A door being closed. A boundary being drawn by a boy who was learning, from someone, that you didn't have to answer every question. "It's just a phone."

She sat down next to him on the steps. The October air was cool and smelled like leaves and exhaust and the particular Baltimore smell that she had breathed her whole life and could not describe to anyone who hadn't — wet brick, old stone, the river somewhere underneath everything, a mineral undercurrent that ran through the city the way a bass line runs through a song. The streetlight at the end of the block cast a yellow cone on the sidewalk. A car passed. Someone's dog barked twice and stopped.

"DeShawn."

"What?"

She looked at him. He was taller than her now. When had that happened? Six months ago, maybe less. He'd gone from her eye level to two inches above it, and the change had happened so fast it felt less like growing and more like leaving, like the boy she had known was being replaced, inch by inch, by a man she did not yet recognize. His jaw had squared. His shoulders had widened. His hands, resting on his knees, were his father's hands — long-fingered, the knuckles prominent, the nails bitten short.

"I need you to look at me," she said.

He turned. His eyes were brown and deep and held the guarded wariness of a teenager who knew he was about to be asked something he didn't want to answer. She'd seen that look before. She'd worn that look, thirty years ago, sitting on these same steps while her own mother asked questions she didn't want to answer about the boys on the corner, about the car that idled at the end of the block, about the world that was always out there waiting for you to step into it.

"I'm not stupid," she said. "Those shoes cost two hundred dollars. That phone costs eight hundred. You don't have a job."

"I'm gonna get one."

"That's not what I asked."

He turned back to the street. The phone's screen had gone dark. His reflection was in it — his face, ghostly and indistinct, a negative image.

"It's just friends, Ma. People I know."

"People like who?"

"You don't know them."

"I know everybody on this block."

"Not from this block."

The silence that followed was not empty. It was full of things she knew and things she wished she didn't know and things she had always known, the way you know the weather before you check — by feel, by instinct, by the ache in your knees that tells you rain is coming before the clouds do.

She knew the signs. She had grown up with them. The new things. The money that came from nowhere. The hours that shifted — out later, home later, the gravitational center of his life moving away from this house and toward something she couldn't see but could feel pulling at him the way a current pulls at a swimmer who doesn't know the current is there.

The signs said gang. The signs had always said gang, in this neighborhood, on these blocks, where the economics of being young and Black and fatherless created a vacuum that the corners filled the way water fills a hole. Not with violence — not at first. First with belonging. First with the thing that every seventeen-year-old boy needed and that the legitimate world was not offering DeShawn Williams: money, protection, status, the feeling of being part of something that wanted you.

She had seen it with Jerome Carter, who'd lived three doors down and who was dead now. She'd seen it with Tyrone's boy, who was in Jessup doing twelve years. She'd seen it a hundred times, the same slow recruitment, the same insidious gentleness with which the life opened its door and said come in, it's warm in here, we've got what you need.

"Okay," she said.

DeShawn looked at her, surprised. He'd expected more questions. More pushing.

"Okay?" he said.

"Okay." She stood up. Her knees popped. She put her hand on the railing, the wrought iron cold under her palm, and she went inside.

She did not sleep that night.

---

The next two weeks were a study in observation. Keisha watched DeShawn the way you watch a crack in a wall — not because you can stop it from spreading, but because you need to know how fast it's moving and in which direction.

He came home later. Eleven, then midnight, then one. He came home happy — that was the worst part. Not agitated, not scared, not high. Happy. The easy, loose-limbed happiness of a boy who had found a place where he belonged, where people laughed at his jokes and asked about his day and made him feel like he was worth something. He came home and went to his room and the music played and Keisha lay in her bed on the other side of the wall and listened to him move around in there, alive and whole and still here, and she told herself that still here was enough for tonight.

But still here was a depleting currency. Each night the balance dropped.

She checked his room when he was out. She was not proud of this. She had sworn, when DeShawn was born, that she would not be the kind of mother who searched through her children's things, that she would trust them the way she had wanted to be trusted, that the relationship would be built on honesty and not surveillance. She had kept that promise for sixteen years.

She found forty dollars in his sock drawer. She found a second phone — a prepaid, the kind you bought at the gas station. She found a piece of paper with an address on it, a block she recognized, a house she knew the reputation of the way everyone in this neighborhood knew the reputations of certain houses.

She put everything back exactly where she'd found it. She closed the drawer. She sat on his bed and pressed her palms into her eyes and stayed there until the pressure behind her face subsided enough for her to stand up and walk out and close the door and be his mother again, which meant being the person who held the fear without letting it spill.

Tiana knew something was wrong. She was fourteen and missed nothing. She looked at Keisha over breakfast with an expression that asked questions her mouth would not, and Keisha looked back with an expression that said *not now, baby* without either of them speaking.

Jaylen knew nothing. Jaylen was ten and the world was still the size of his school and his friends and the couch and the television. Keisha wanted to keep it that way. She wanted to keep one child in the country where things were simple, even if the borders of that country were shrinking every day.

---

She confronted him on a Saturday. Not because Saturday was better or worse than any other day, but because it was the day her body decided it had carried the weight long enough.

He was getting ready to go out. She heard him in his room — drawers opening, the hiss of spray deodorant, the sounds of a boy assembling himself for the world. She knocked once and opened the door without waiting.

He was standing in front of the mirror on the back of his closet door. New jacket. Not a Jordans-level jacket — a North Face, the kind that cost enough to notice but not enough to alarm. Incremental. That was how it worked. The new things arrived in increments, each one small enough to explain away, and by the time you added them all up the total was undeniable.

"Sit down," she said.

"Ma, I'm going out."

"I know you're going out. Sit down."

Something in her voice reached him. Not the words — the frequency beneath them. The frequency of a mother who was not asking. He sat on the edge of his bed. She closed the door behind her. The room was small — a twin bed, a dresser, the closet, a poster of somebody she didn't recognize on the wall — and with the door closed it felt like an interrogation room, which was exactly what it was about to become.

She stood in front of him. She did not sit. She stood because standing gave her the authority that this conversation required, and because if she sat down she was afraid she would lose the ability to say what she needed to say.

"I know what you're doing," she said.

"Ma—"

"Don't." She held up one hand. "Don't tell me it's friends. Don't tell me somebody's lending you things. Don't tell me it's a job. I have been in this neighborhood my entire life, DeShawn. I was born six blocks from here. I watched boys go through the same door you're walking through right now, and I know where it leads."

He looked at the floor. His hands were between his knees. The hands that were his father's hands, the long fingers, the bitten nails. His jaw was tight.

"You don't know what it's like," he said.

"Tell me."

"You don't — Ma, you work two jobs. Tiana needs new glasses. Jaylen's shoes have holes in them. I can see you counting every dollar like it's the last one, and I just—" He stopped. His voice had cracked on the last word, not from emotion but from the simple mechanical failure of a seventeen-year-old's voice under pressure. "I can help. That's all. I can help."

Keisha felt something collapse inside her. Not break — collapse, the way a building collapses, slowly and all at once, the structure giving way floor by floor. Because he was not wrong. The shoes did have holes. Tiana did need glasses. The math of their life did not work, had never worked, was a problem with no solution inside the parameters she'd been given, and DeShawn had found a set of parameters that solved it.

"Help," she said. The word tasted like ash. "You think that's help."

"It's money, Ma. It's real money."

"It's not real. None of it is real. It's real until they need something from you, and then you find out what the money costs."

"You don't know these people."

"I do know them. I've known them my whole life. They change their names and their clothes and their cars, but they're the same. They find boys like you — smart, strong, loyal — and they tell you you're family, and they give you things, and then one day they ask you for something and you can't say no because you already said yes a hundred times without knowing it."

DeShawn looked at her. His eyes were wet but his face was hard, the hardness of a boy fighting against a truth he could feel pressing in from all sides.

"I can handle it," he said.

She sat down then. On the bed, next to him, close enough that their shoulders almost touched. The bedspring squeaked under her weight. The room smelled like his deodorant and like something else — the underlying smell of a teenage boy's bedroom, socks and sleep and the chemical residue of whatever product he put in his hair.

"Let me tell you about your father," she said.

He went still.

She had never told him the real story. She had told him the version that a child could carry — *your father left, he had his reasons, it wasn't about you*. It was a version built from omissions, the way a wall is built from bricks: each missing brick was deliberate, structural, holding up the shape of something that could be lived with.

Now she took the wall apart.

"Your father didn't leave," she said. "Not the way I told you. He got involved with the same kind of people you're spending time with. Same kind of promises. Same kind of money. He was nineteen when he started. He was twenty-two when he went to prison."

DeShawn was staring at her. His mouth was slightly open. The hardness in his face had cracked.

"Prison," he said.

"Jessup. Aggravated assault. He got into a fight over territory — a corner, DeShawn, a piece of sidewalk — and he beat a man so badly the man lost sight in one eye. The judge gave him fifteen years."

She paused. The words were heavy in her mouth. She had carried them for so long they had become part of her anatomy, organs she'd grown around, and removing them now was a kind of surgery she had not prepared for.

"He died in Jessup. In 2008. There was a riot. A corrections officer was killed, and three inmates, and your father was one of them."

The sound DeShawn made was not a word. It was the sound of something being hit — a short, sharp exhalation, like the air had been knocked out of him.

"He was thirty-one years old," Keisha said. "You were a year old when he went in. You never knew him. And that's because the people he chose — the same kind of people who are giving you shoes and phones right now — they used him until there was nothing left to use, and then he was in a cell, and then he was dead."

"Why didn't you tell me." His voice was flat. Not a question.

"Because you were a child. Because I wanted you to grow up without carrying it."

"So you lied."

"I left things out."

"That's lying, Ma."

"Maybe it is." She didn't look away from him. Her eyes were dry. She had decided, somewhere between the bedroom door and this sentence, that she would not cry in front of him. That the crying would come later, alone, in the dark, the way it always did. "Maybe I should have told you when you were twelve. Or fourteen. Or the first time you came home with new shoes. But I didn't. And I'm telling you now."

He stood up. The bed shifted with his weight gone from it. He walked to the window and put his hands on the sill and looked out at the street, the same street she looked at from the kitchen, the same row houses and chain-link fences and cracked sidewalks that had been here before either of them and would be here after.

"He had the same choice you have right now," she said to his back. "Same people. Same promises. He chose them. And they used him up and threw him away."

"Don't compare me to him."

"I'm not comparing you. I'm showing you the path."

He turned around. His face was wet now. The tears had come without him seeming to notice, the way a faucet leaks — steady, involuntary, the mechanism broken. His jaw was clenched and his nostrils flared and in his face she could see the war between grief and anger, the two forces pulling at him like tides.

"You kept this from me for seventeen years," he said. "You let me think he just left. Like I wasn't worth staying for. And the whole time he was in prison, and then he was dead, and you just — you just kept going. You kept packing my lunch and telling me to do my homework and acting like everything was fine."

"Everything was not fine. Everything has never been fine. I kept going because that's what you do."

"That's what *you* do." He grabbed the jacket off the chair. "I do something different."

He went past her through the door. She heard his footsteps on the stairs, heavy, two at a time, and then the front door opened and closed, not slammed — he didn't slam it, which somehow was worse than if he had, because slamming was rage and not-slamming was something colder and more permanent.

She sat on his bed. The room was quiet. Through the wall she could hear Tiana's music, something soft, headphones leaking. Through the floor she could hear Jaylen's television, the laugh track.

She sat there for a long time.

---

He didn't come home that night. Or the next.

On the third day he came back to get clothes. She was at the grocery store. Tiana told her. He'd been in and out in ten minutes, a duffel bag, the Jordans, the jacket, the phones. He left nothing that mattered and took nothing that was hers.

Keisha called his cell — the original one, the number she had. It rang six times and went to voicemail, and his voice on the recording was the voice of a boy she used to know, younger than the one who had walked out, and the distance between those two voices was the distance between everything she had built and everything she was losing.

She went to work. She stocked shelves at the grocery store from six to two. She cleaned offices from six to ten. In between she cooked dinner and checked Tiana's homework and put Jaylen to bed and occupied the hours with the mechanics of survival, which was the only thing she knew how to do when the ground shifted under her feet — keep moving, keep the hands busy, keep the shape of the day intact even when the contents had been hollowed out.

On the fourth night her phone rang at one in the morning. She was awake. She had been awake every night since he left, her body refusing to shut down, her mind running the same circuit: where is he, is he safe, is he alive, is he standing on a corner, is he in a car, is he doing something that will close doors that can never be reopened.

"Ma."

His voice. She pressed the phone against her ear so hard the plastic dug into her cheekbone.

"Where are you?"

"I'm okay."

"That's not what I asked."

A pause. In the background she could hear other voices, low, indistinct. A bass line from speakers.

"I need to handle some things," he said. "I'll be home soon."

"DeShawn—"

"I love you, Ma."

He hung up.

She sat on the edge of her bed and held the phone in both hands and stared at the dark rectangle of the screen the way she had stared at the window when her father left, thirty-three years ago, watching the red car disappear down Ashland Avenue, pressing her fingers against the glass.

---

The arrest happened on a Wednesday.

She was not there when it happened. She would piece it together later from the officer's report and from what DeShawn's public defender told her in a hallway that smelled like floor cleaner and anxiety, a hallway in a building she had hoped she would never see the inside of.

There had been a confrontation. DeShawn and three others. A corner that belonged to one crew and was being contested by another. DeShawn had been carrying a weapon — not a gun, a knife, which his lawyer said mattered and which Keisha knew mattered only in the arithmetic of sentencing and not in the arithmetic of what her son had become. There had been a fight. No one was killed. One person was cut — not by DeShawn, the lawyer said, though DeShawn had been holding the knife when the police arrived, and holding a knife at the scene of a stabbing was its own kind of verdict.

He was charged as an adult. Aggravated assault. Possession of a deadly weapon. The judge set bail at fifty thousand dollars. Keisha did not have fifty thousand dollars. Keisha did not have five thousand dollars. Keisha had the contents of the jar on top of the refrigerator, which held six hundred and forty dollars and represented three months of saving, and the jar might as well have been empty for all the distance between it and the number on the bail sheet.

She saw him at the detention center. He was in an orange jumpsuit that was too big in the shoulders and too short in the arms, and his face had changed in the two weeks since she'd seen him last. Not aged, exactly — sharpened. The softness had been filed away. He sat across from her at a table that was bolted to the floor and he did not look at her and he did not cry and she did not cry and the room had a clock on the wall that ticked loud enough to hear, and the ticking was the only sound for a long time.

"Three years," his lawyer said, later. Plea deal. The alternative was trial, which meant a jury, which meant a Black boy with a knife in Baltimore in 2024, which meant a sentence that could stretch to seven. Three years was the better number. Three years was the margin.

Keisha signed the papers. She signed them at a desk in a room with no windows, and the pen was chained to the desk, and the chain was short enough that she had to lean forward to write, and the posture felt like bowing, like supplication, like the physical grammar of a system that had been designed to make you small.

---

The police car was a white sedan with the blue stripe. She watched it from the porch. DeShawn was in the back seat, his hands in his lap, his face turned toward the window. For a moment — one moment, no longer — he looked at her. His expression was unreadable. Not angry, not sad, not scared. Just present. Just here, in this body, in this car, in this moment that was the hinge between everything before and everything after.

The car turned at the end of the block. She watched until it was gone.

She stood on the porch. The October air was cold. The streetlight buzzed. Mrs. Patterson's cat was sitting on the stoop across the street, cleaning its paw with the mechanical patience of a creature that did not know what loss was.

Keisha went inside. She closed the door. She locked it — knob, deadbolt, chain, the sequence automatic, the same sequence she'd been performing since she was nine years old and her mother taught her how to secure a house.

She made it to the kitchen. She put her hands on the counter and leaned forward and the weight of what she was carrying bent her at the waist, and she made a sound that was not crying, not yet, a sound that came from somewhere below her chest, somewhere in the basement of who she was, a sound like a foundation cracking.

Then the tears came.

They came the way rain comes after a long drought — all at once, total, a collapse of whatever membrane had been holding them back. She cried with her hands on the counter and her head down, and the crying was ugly, the raw, helpless sound of a woman who had done everything she knew how to do and it had not been enough. She cried for DeShawn, who was in the back of a police car. She cried for his father, who had been in the back of a police car twenty-two years ago and who had never come home. She cried for the nine-year-old girl who had stood at a window and watched a red car drive away and who had somehow, impossibly, become this — a forty-two-year-old woman in a kitchen, alone, the same street outside, the same crack in the ceiling, the same distance between the world she wanted and the world she had.

Tiana appeared in the doorway. She stood there in her pajamas with her glasses on and her hair in two braids and her face full of a knowledge that no fourteen-year-old should carry. She didn't ask what was wrong. She walked to her mother and put her arms around her from behind, her face pressed between Keisha's shoulder blades, and she held on.

They stood like that in the kitchen. The refrigerator hummed. The faucet dripped. Somewhere outside a siren wound through the night, the sound rising and falling, and it could have been any siren, for any reason, on any night in Baltimore, and it meant nothing and everything, the way sirens always did.

Keisha put her hand over Tiana's hand. She squeezed. She straightened up. She wiped her face with the back of her wrist.

"Go to bed, baby," she said.

"Mama—"

"Go to bed. I'm okay."

Tiana let go. She stood there for a moment, her face asking the questions her mouth wouldn't, and then she turned and went upstairs, her footsteps light on the stairs, and Keisha listened until the footsteps reached the second floor and the bedroom door closed.

She turned off the kitchen light. She checked the lock. Knob, deadbolt, chain. She walked to the front window and looked out at the street where her son had been an hour ago and where he would not be for three years, and the street was empty and orange under the streetlight, and the night was quiet, and the city breathed around her — exhaust and old brick and the river underneath everything — and Keisha Williams stood in the dark and breathed with it.

Three years. He would survive. That was not nothing. In this neighborhood, on these blocks, surviving was its own kind of victory, the lowest possible bar and the highest possible hope. He would go in a boy. He would come out — what? She didn't know. Prison was not redemption. She knew that from the women she'd grown up with, the ones who waited, the ones whose men came back different, harder, the softness filed down to something that could survive concrete and count time but could not remember how to sit in a kitchen and be still. Prison was a holding pattern. A place where time passed and nothing grew.

But he would be alive. He would be alive, and alive was the starting line, and everything else — the healing, the rebuilding, the long work of becoming someone who could walk down this street without the street pulling him under — everything else would have to be built from alive.

She went to bed. She lay in the dark and looked at the ceiling and thought about the twenty-dollar bill she had found on the sidewalk when she was nine, the one that was clean and dry on a damp day, the one she couldn't explain. She thought about the boy on the steps with the broken shoe. She thought about giving away five dollars when she had nothing because her mother had said *I had it and she needed it*, and the math had seemed so simple then, the arithmetic of generosity, clean and straight.

The math was not simple. The math had never been simple. The math was a problem with no solution, a system of equations with more unknowns than knowns, and you did the math anyway because the alternative was not doing anything, and not doing anything was another word for drowning, and she had never learned to drown.

She closed her eyes. Tomorrow she would get up at five. She would make breakfast. She would go to work. She would come home and make dinner and check homework and put Jaylen to bed and lie in this bed and stare at this ceiling and do the whole thing again, and the day after that, and the day after that, for three years, for a thousand days, each day a brick in a wall she was building between her family and the world that wanted to tear it down.

She would build it. She had always built it. That was what she did.

Outside, the city settled into its late-night hum. A dog barked. A car passed. The streetlight buzzed its yellow buzz. And on Ashland Avenue the row houses stood shoulder to shoulder in the dark, the way they had for fifty years, holding each other up.
