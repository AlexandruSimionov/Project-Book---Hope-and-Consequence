# Chapter 3: What Rosa Saw

**March 14, 1985 — St. Michael's Hospital, Queens, New York**

---

The heart monitor flatlined at 3:07 AM, and Rosa Chen's body convulsed once on the table, then went still.

Dr. Sarah Morrison — twenty-eight, third-year resident, running on four hours of sleep across two days — looked at the clock, then at the nurse. The nurse, Denise, who had been at St. Michael's for twenty years and whose hands never shook, was already pulling back. Eighteen minutes of compressions. The ribs had given at minute six, that awful wet crunch that Sarah still heard in her dreams sometimes. The epinephrine had done nothing. The defibrillator had done nothing. Eighteen minutes was long past the point where you called it.

Sarah opened her mouth to say the words.

Something stopped her.

Later, she would describe it as a voice, though it wasn't a voice. It was more like a current in the air, a shift in pressure. As if the room had leaned toward her and breathed: *Try once more.*

She reached for the paddles.

"Doctor," Denise said. Not objecting. Just noting the time.

"One more," Sarah said.

The shock jolted Rosa Chen's body off the table by an inch. The monitor shrieked its single note. Then — like a fist unclenching — the line stuttered. Blipped. Found a rhythm.

Denise said, "Oh."

Rosa Chen's heart beat on its own for the first time in eighteen minutes.

---

Rosa does not know she has died.

She knows she was in a hospital. She knows there was a pain in her chest like a hand squeezing, squeezing, the fist of some god wringing the blood from her heart while she sat watching *Jeopardy!* in her daughter's living room. She remembers the ambulance. She remembers the fluorescent lights above her, racing past like dashes on a highway, and the face of a young paramedic whose acne reminded her of Bobby Fong, who had been in her third-grade class in 1961 and who could never remember the difference between *there* and *their*.

Then the pain crested and broke, and now she is here.

*Here* is not a place.

It is a field of light — not white, not golden, but a color she has no name for, something between the amber of late-afternoon sun through her kitchen curtains and the deep violet of the jacaranda trees she saw once, years ago, in Los Angeles, visiting her cousin Helen. The light moves. It breathes. It has texture, like silk pulled taut over something vast and living.

Rosa is not afraid. This surprises her. She has been afraid of death her whole life — afraid in the way a practical woman is afraid, not dramatically, but persistently, the way you fear an unpaid bill. And now the bill has come due and it is nothing like what she expected.

She tries to look down at her hands. She has no hands.

She is not a body. She is — attention. A point of seeing.

The light shifts, and she sees faces.

They come fast, overlapping, like photographs thrown into the air. An old man with deep lines around his mouth, laughing. A young woman in a yellow headscarf. A boy she does not recognize — eight or nine, skinny, dark-haired, with her late husband's narrow jaw. The boy is in water. He is sinking. His arms churn the surface and his mouth opens and the water goes in and Rosa tries to scream but she has no mouth, she has no lungs, she is only watching and the boy is drowning and then—

Another boy. Older. Twelve, maybe. Darker skin, wide-set eyes, moving through the water with purpose, grabbing the drowning boy under the arms and hauling him up, up, into the air and the light and the noise of other children screaming.

The drowning boy coughs. Water comes out of him in a thin stream. He breathes.

Rosa does not know these children. She knows them the way you know a word on the tip of your tongue — the shape of it, the weight of it, but not the sound.

The vision pivots. She is somewhere else now. A room with no windows, lit by the cold blue glow of a machine she does not understand. The dark-haired boy is older here — a young man, mid-twenties, hunched over a workbench. His fingers are stained. He is holding something up to the light: a membrane, thin as onion skin, iridescent. He turns it in his hands the way Rosa used to turn her reading glasses, checking for smudges. He is studying it with an intensity that borders on prayer.

She wants to speak to him. She wants to say — what? *Be careful. Eat something. You look too thin.* The things she has said to every child she has ever known, the vocabulary of care that was her native language for forty years in a second-grade classroom.

He cannot hear her. She is not there.

The light moves again and now there is a woman.

No. Not a woman. Something wearing the outline of a woman the way a lamp wears a shade — the shape is human, but what comes through it is not. Rosa sees her, and her mind reaches for comparisons: sunrise through fog. A candle seen through frosted glass. The filament inside a bulb at the moment of ignition. None of these are right. The being is made of something Rosa's vocabulary cannot hold. She is luminous and heavy with grief, sorrowful in a way that has nothing to do with self-pity and everything to do with duration. She has been sad for a long time. She has been sad with purpose.

An angel, Rosa thinks. The word arrives without effort, the way the word *mother* arrives when you see your mother's face.

An angel made of tears and patience.

The angel is looking at her. Or — past her. Through her. Into some distance Rosa cannot perceive. The angel's expression is one Rosa recognizes from decades of teaching: the look of someone who sees a child about to make a terrible mistake and cannot intervene. Can only watch. Can only hold their breath and hope.

Who are you waiting for? Rosa tries to ask.

The angel does not answer. But the light shifts again and Rosa sees: the dark-haired boy, older still, standing on a balcony at night, gripping the railing with both hands. She sees a classroom full of small wooden desks and a teacher whose face she cannot make out. She sees an old woman — herself? No, someone else, someone decades from now — leaning over a hospital bed. She sees a web of light connecting all of these images, threads running between them like the strings on a loom, and she understands without understanding that she is seeing a pattern. That these faces and these moments are not random. That they are connected in ways she cannot name, the way the roots of trees are connected underground, each one feeding the others in darkness.

She sees the angel again. The angel is weeping. No — the angel is made of weeping. Her substance is grief held so long it has become something structural, load-bearing. And Rosa thinks: *You poor thing. You poor, exhausted thing.*

The light begins to fade.

Rosa reaches for it — reaches with whatever she is, this bodiless point of attention — and the pattern recedes like a wave pulling back from shore, leaving behind the ordinary dark, the ordinary cold, the ordinary small humming pain of a body that has been broken and restarted.

---

She opened her eyes to fluorescent light and a ceiling made of perforated tiles. Someone was holding her hand. The hand was warm and slightly damp.

"Mrs. Chen?" A young voice. The doctor. "Mrs. Chen, can you hear me?"

Rosa tried to speak. Her throat was full of gravel. She had been intubated — she would learn this later — and the tube had scraped her raw.

"There were lights," she said.

Dr. Sarah Morrison looked at the nurse. The nurse, Denise, smiled in the careful way nurses smiled when elderly patients said unusual things. Polite. Bracketing.

"You're in the hospital, Mrs. Chen. You had a cardiac event. Your heart stopped for eighteen minutes. We brought you back."

"There were lights," Rosa said again. Because there were. Because that was true.

"That's very common," Sarah said gently. "A lot of patients report seeing lights."

Rosa wanted to say: *Not like this.* She wanted to say: *I saw a boy who looks like my husband and he was drowning and then he wasn't, and I saw him older and he was building something, something important, and there was an angel, a real angel, not the kind on Christmas cards, not the kind with harps and halos, an angel who was tired and sad and brave and who has been waiting for something for longer than I can imagine.*

What came out was: "There were lights."

Sarah patted her hand. "Try to rest."

---

Rosa's daughter, Lily, arrived at 6:30 AM. She was thirty-five years old, a real estate agent in Flushing, practical and brisk in the way daughters of immigrant mothers become when they have spent their lives translating between two worlds. She brought a thermos of congee and a change of clothes and the particular tight-lipped expression she wore when she was afraid but had decided not to show it.

"Mama," she said, sitting on the edge of the bed. "The doctor says you died."

"I know," Rosa said.

"For eighteen minutes."

"I know."

Lily unscrewed the thermos. The congee was plain, with a little ginger and salt, the way Rosa had made it for Lily when she was sick as a child. Lily had learned the recipe without being taught — by watching, by proximity, by the slow osmosis of a shared kitchen.

"She says you need a pacemaker," Lily said. "And physical therapy. And a new diet."

"I saw things," Rosa said.

Lily held the spoon to her mother's lips. "Eat first."

---

Over the next six months, Rosa tried to tell her daughter what she had seen. She tried in the hospital, propped up against starched pillows, her chest stitched and stapled and aching. She tried at Lily's house, where she had moved after the doctors said she could not live alone anymore. She tried at the kitchen table, in the garden, on the porch where Lily's husband, James, smoked his evening cigarettes and pretended he didn't.

The problem was language. Rosa had spent forty years as an elementary school teacher. She had taught children the alphabet. She had taught them to spell *because* and *beautiful* and *believe*. She knew words the way a carpenter knows wood — intimately, structurally. And she could not find the right ones.

"I saw a boy," she told Lily one evening in April. They were shelling peas on the porch. The air smelled like cut grass and James's cigarette smoke. "A boy who looked like your father."

"Mama."

"He was drowning. In a swimming pool, I think. And another boy pulled him out."

"You were hallucinating. The doctor said—"

"I wasn't hallucinating. It was different." Rosa cracked a pea pod. Inside, the peas were bright and tightly packed. "I saw him older, too. He was a scientist. Or an engineer. He was working with something — a kind of thin material, like fabric but not fabric."

Lily shelled peas and said nothing.

"And there was an angel," Rosa said.

"Mama."

"I know what you're thinking. I'm not crazy and I'm not senile. I saw an angel."

Lily set down her bowl. She had her father's face — the same long jaw, the same flat skepticism in the eyes. Rosa had loved that face for twenty-seven years of marriage, and she loved it now in its daughter-shaped echo.

"What did the angel look like?" Lily asked. Humoring her. Rosa could hear it in the careful, even tone, the same voice Lily used with difficult clients.

"Sad," Rosa said. "Very old and very sad. She was made of light, but the light was — heavy. Thick. Like she'd been carrying something for a long time."

"And this angel. Did she say anything?"

"No. She was watching. Waiting."

Lily picked up her bowl again. "Yes, Mama."

---

In May, Rosa told Lily about the pattern. They were in the kitchen. Lily was making dinner — steamed fish, bok choy, rice — and Rosa was sitting at the table because she was no longer allowed to stand for long periods. Her chest ached in the mornings and the evenings, a dull, structural pain, as if the doctors had rebuilt her heart from slightly wrong parts.

"It wasn't random," Rosa said. "The things I saw. They were connected. Like a — like when you string lights on a Christmas tree. Each bulb is separate but they're all on the same wire."

"The fish is almost done," Lily said.

"The boy drowning, and the boy being saved, and the boy in the laboratory — they're the same boy. Different ages. I'm sure of it."

"We need more soy sauce."

"Lily. I am telling you something important."

Lily set down her spatula. She turned to face her mother. Rosa could see the effort it cost her — the setting-aside of the fish, the soy sauce, the evening's routine — to stand still and listen to a story that made no sense.

"I'm listening, Mama."

"I think the boy is family. I think he's — I don't know. A grandson. Or a great-grandson. Someone who hasn't been born yet."

"Mama, I'm not even pregnant."

"I know that."

"James and I aren't—"

"I *know* that." Rosa folded her hands on the table. Her fingers were thin, veined, spotted with age. They had graded ten thousand spelling tests. They had wiped ten thousand noses. They had braided hair and tied shoes and held small hands across busy streets. "I'm telling you what I saw. You don't have to believe me. But I want you to remember it."

Lily looked at her mother for a long moment. Then she turned back to the fish.

"I'll remember," she said.

---

June. July. The days grew long and hot. Rosa sat in Lily's garden and watched the tomato plants grow. She had always kept a garden — at the house in Flushing, before the landlord sold it, she had grown tomatoes and green beans and Chinese long beans and, once, a single watermelon that split open in the August heat and fed every kid on the block. Now she watched Lily's garden and offered advice that Lily did not take.

Her strength ebbed. The pacemaker ticked away in her chest, faithful and mechanical, but the rest of her was winding down. She could feel it — the slow recession of vitality, like a tide going out. She slept more. She ate less. She dreamed, sometimes, of the light, and woke with her hands reaching for something that wasn't there.

She told Lily about the angel five more times. Each time, the details shifted slightly — not because Rosa was inventing, but because the vision was larger than her memory, and each retelling caught a different facet, the way you can describe a diamond differently depending on which face you hold to the light.

She told Lily about a classroom. She told her about a woman in a yellow headscarf. She told her about the old man laughing. These details meant nothing to Lily, who listened and nodded and said "Yes, Mama" in the same gentle, bracketing voice.

Once, in August, Rosa said: "I think I taught one of them. One of the people in the vision. A long time ago."

"One of your students?"

"Maybe. I can't remember. I had so many." Thirty-eight years of second-graders. Hundreds of children passing through her classroom, each one briefly hers, then gone. She remembered some clearly — Bobby Fong with his misspellings, Maria Santos who could multiply three-digit numbers in her head, a skinny blond boy with a stammer whose name she couldn't recall — and others had faded into the general blur of small faces and small hands and the smell of paste and pencil shavings.

She did not remember Thomas Reed. He had been in her class for one year — 1962, her second year of teaching, before she had learned to anchor her students' names in memory. A quiet boy, serious, who sat in the third row and did his homework neatly and never caused trouble. He passed through her classroom like water through a sieve, leaving no trace.

Thomas Reed did not remember her either. He had been seven years old. His teacher had been a young Chinese-American woman who smelled like chalk and called him "Thomas, dear" and who had, once, let him stay inside during recess to read because it was raining and he didn't have a raincoat. He did not remember this. It was gone, filed in the deep sediment of early childhood, as irretrievable as the taste of his first birthday cake.

They had shared a year. In that year, Rosa had taught Thomas Reed to spell *because* and *beautiful* and *believe*. Decades later, Thomas Reed would become a prosecutor. He would build a reputation on harsh sentencing. He would send a young man named David Okonkwo to prison for fifteen years. And David Okonkwo, at twelve years old, would pull a drowning boy from a swimming pool — a boy named Marcus Chen, Rosa's grandson, the child Rosa saw in her vision, the child who had not yet been born.

But Rosa did not know any of this. She saw pieces of a pattern and could not see the whole. She held fragments of a future that was, to her, only light and faces and a feeling of vast, aching significance.

---

September came. The tomatoes ripened and split on the vine. Rosa grew thinner. The pain in her chest became a companion, constant and low, like a radio left on in another room.

On September 8th, Lily found her mother in the garden, sitting in the folding chair with a blanket over her knees, watching a cardinal on the fence post.

"Mama, come inside. It's getting cold."

"Not yet." Rosa watched the cardinal. It was a male, bright red, its crest lifted. "Lily."

"Yes, Mama."

"The boy I saw. The one who will be a scientist. An angel is going to help him."

Lily crouched beside her mother's chair. In eleven years, after a divorce and a second marriage to a man named Robert Chen, she would have a son. She would name him Marcus, after her mother's father. She did not know any of this yet. She was just a woman kneeling in a garden, holding her mother's hand.

"Okay, Mama."

"Angels will help him. Remember that. Angels will help."

"I'll remember."

"Promise me."

"I promise, Mama."

Rosa nodded. The cardinal flew off. The sky above Queens was the color of a bruise fading to yellow, and somewhere in the distance a car alarm was going off, that familiar two-note wail, and from the kitchen came the smell of rice cooking, and Rosa thought: *This is enough. This is a good place to rest.*

---

She died on September 22nd, 1985, six months and eight days after her heart had stopped and started again. She died in Lily's guest bedroom, in a single bed with a brass frame, with the window open because she liked the air even when it was cold. Lily was beside her. James was downstairs making tea. The pacemaker in her chest continued its measured beating for eleven minutes after the rest of her had gone, like a clock ticking in an empty house.

Lily held her mother's hand until it cooled.

Then she got up, closed the window, and went downstairs to tell James.

---

The story did not die with Rosa.

Lily told it to Robert, the man she married, on their fourth date. She told it as a funny-sad thing her mother had said, the way you tell stories about eccentric relatives — with affection, with a slight roll of the eyes, with the unstated subtext of *she was a little out of it at the end.*

"She said she saw angels," Lily told Robert over dinner. "She said they were going to protect her grandson."

"Did she have a grandson?"

"No. I wasn't even pregnant. I wasn't even dating."

Robert laughed. Lily laughed. They ordered dessert.

But the story lodged. It became a family artifact — not quite believed, not quite dismissed, passed down the way all family stories are passed down: compressed, simplified, stripped of context, gaining sentiment and losing specificity with each retelling.

When Marcus was born in 1996 — eleven years after Rosa's death, after Lily had divorced James and married a man named Robert Chen and, at forty-six, against all expectation, become pregnant — Lily looked at her son's face, red, scrunched, outraged at the cold bright world, and thought of her mother. She thought: *Is this the one you saw?*

She did not say this to anyone.

When Marcus was eight and nearly drowned at a community pool in the Bronx — when a twelve-year-old boy she'd never seen before dove in and pulled her son to the surface, coughing and gasping and alive — Lily stood at the pool's edge with a towel and her heart in her mouth and thought of her mother again.

"Your grandmother said angels would protect you," she told Marcus that night, tucking him into bed. His hair was still damp. He smelled like chlorine.

"I don't have a grandmother," Marcus said. He was eight. He was literal.

"You did. She died before you were born. She said angels would help you."

Marcus considered this with the grave seriousness of an eight-year-old evaluating an unlikely claim. "Was it an angel that pulled me out?"

"No, baby. It was a boy."

"Then it wasn't an angel."

Lily smoothed his hair. "Go to sleep."

Marcus went to sleep. He filed the story in the place children file stories that don't make sense — somewhere deep, inaccessible, beside fairy tales and half-remembered dreams. It was still there years later, when he was twenty-one and struggling through his PhD, and twenty-eight and standing on a balcony wondering if any of it was worth the fight. It surfaced sometimes like a coin in a fountain catching the light: *Your grandmother said angels would protect you.*

He never believed it. But he never quite forgot it either.

And Rosa — who had taught second grade for thirty-eight years, who had graded ten thousand spelling tests, who had seen a vision she could not explain and spent her last six months trying to hand it to a daughter who could not hold it — Rosa had done what she could. She had planted the seed. She could not know what it would grow into, any more than she could know that one of her second-graders would become a prosecutor, or that a boy she saw drowning in a vision would be her own grandson, or that the tired angel in the light was, at this very moment, sitting in a waiting room down the hall, drinking bad coffee from a paper cup, looking as ordinary and as broken as anyone.

She had seen the pattern. She could not read it.

But she passed it on.
