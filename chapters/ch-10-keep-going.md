# Chapter 10: Keep Going

**November 2008 — Hargrove College of Fine Arts, Western Massachusetts**

---

The review lasted eleven minutes. Elena timed it because there was a clock on the wall behind Professor Lindquist's head, a round institutional clock with a second hand that moved in small, visible jerks, and she had watched it the way you watch something when you cannot look at the person speaking to you. Eleven minutes for four years of work. She had carried in twelve pieces — oils, mixed media, a charcoal series she'd spent the entire summer on — and arranged them along the crit room wall with the care of someone setting a table for guests who mattered. She had thought about sightlines. She had thought about how the afternoon light from the windows would fall across the brushwork. She had worn the clean button-down, the one without paint on the cuffs.

Professor Lindquist sat in the plastic chair across from the display and looked at Elena's four years the way a man looks at a parking ticket. He was fifty-three and had shown at galleries in Chelsea when Chelsea still meant something, and he carried this history in his posture, in the slight backward lean of a man who had once been relevant and was now comfortable. Elena had admired him once — genuinely, the way a young artist admires someone who has done the thing she wants to do. That admiration had thinned over four years into something more cautious, an awareness that Lindquist's taste was a closed system, self-referencing and airtight.

But he was the gatekeeper. His signature went on the review.

"You're technically skilled," he said, after seven of the eleven minutes had passed in silence. He said it the way a doctor says *the X-ray is clear* before delivering the rest of the sentence.

"The draftsmanship is above average. Composition is solid. You understand color theory." He paused. Removed his glasses. Cleaned them on the hem of his black T-shirt — a gesture Elena had seen him perform dozens of times in seminars, a performance of thoughtfulness that preceded his most decisive pronouncements. "But there's nothing here."

He put the glasses back on.

"Technically skilled but emotionally vacant. That's the gap. I can see what you've learned. I can't see who you are." He gestured toward the charcoal series — the one that had cost her a job at the frame shop because she'd called in sick three times in two weeks to keep working. "These are accomplished exercises. But they're exercises. There's no risk in them. You're hiding behind the technique."

Elena sat with her hands in her lap and did not speak.

"I'll be honest with you," Lindquist said, and the phrase arrived with the particular weight it always carried when spoken by someone who was about to be unkind and wanted credit for it. "I don't see a future for you as an artist. I see a future as an illustrator, maybe. A designer. Someone who executes other people's visions competently. But the thing that separates a craftsperson from an artist is the willingness to be seen, and you — " He shook his head. "You won't let anyone see you."

He stood. He gathered his notes. He left.

The door closed with the soft pneumatic hiss of institutional hardware, and Elena sat alone among her twelve pieces and thought, with the flat clarity of exhaustion: *He's right.*

Not about all of it. Not about the future — though at that moment the future felt like a word in a language she no longer spoke. But about the work. About the hiding. She looked at the charcoal series and she could see it now, the careful distance between herself and the marks she'd made, the way every stroke was controlled and emptied of anything that might betray the person holding the charcoal. She had worked so hard to be good that she had removed everything that might have made the work true.

She sat there for a long time. The light from the windows moved across the floor in the slow way that afternoon light moves in November, a low, slanting gold that made the scuffed linoleum look almost warm. Outside, someone was playing guitar — badly, with the cheerful incompetence of a beginner who had not yet learned to be embarrassed. Elena listened to the guitar and the ventilation hum and the clock's small mechanical jerks, and she did not cry.

She packed up the pieces. She carried them to her dorm room and leaned them against the wall. She sat on the edge of her bed and she looked at them.

Then she opened her closet and took out her coat.

The roof of Whitfield Hall was not difficult to reach. A maintenance door on the fourth floor, always unlocked because the building's heating system was unreliable and the staff needed frequent access to the rooftop units. Elena pushed through it and stepped out onto the gravel and the cold hit her like a wall.

November in western Massachusetts. The wind came from the north, across the hills, carrying the smell of dead leaves and wood smoke and the mineral edge of approaching winter. It was the kind of cold that found the gaps — the space between collar and neck, the thin skin at her wrists, the exposed strip of ankle above her sneakers. Elena's coat was a thrift-store peacoat, navy blue, missing one button. Twelve dollars sophomore year. The nicest coat she owned.

The sky was the color of zinc — a flat, even gray that erased the horizon and made the campus below look like a model of itself. Dusk was coming, though it was hard to say from where. The light was simply leaving, draining from the day without direction, just a general lessening.

Elena walked to the edge.

<!-- AGENT:NOTE — Height/precariousness per SITUATIONAL_INTERPRETATION.md; environmental details reflecting Elena's perceptual filter (artist's eye for light, color, composition) -->

The parapet wall was low — knee-height, poured concrete with a metal railing bolted to its top. The railing was aluminum, dull and cold, and when Elena placed her hands on it she could feel the wind vibrating through the metal, a constant low tremor, as if the building were shivering. Below her, the courtyard spread out in a neat rectangle: paved pathways cutting diagonal lines between patches of brown grass, wooden benches, a maintenance shed in the far corner with a corrugated metal roof and a padlock on the door. Beyond that, the campus. Beyond that, the town. Beyond that, the hills, going gray.

She could hear traffic from the road along the campus's western edge. A distant siren. The wind in the trees — the remaining leaves made a sound like paper being crumpled, and beneath it the bare branches creaked in a way that was almost a voice. The rooftop heating units hummed and clicked. A vent exhaled warm air that smelled of dust and metal.

Elena stood at the railing and looked down.

She was not crying. She had been emptied of crying somewhere between the crit room and the fourth-floor hallway, the tears used up or pushed past or simply made irrelevant by the thing that had settled into her chest — not grief but something flatter and heavier. A conviction. She did not belong here. She had never belonged here. She was a working-class kid from Bridgeport who had gotten into art school on a scholarship and a portfolio of careful, controlled, emotionally vacant drawings, and she had spent four years learning to be technically skilled at something that did not want her, and now a man in a linen blazer had confirmed what she had suspected since orientation week: that wanting was not enough. That the gap between where she stood and where real artists stood was not a gap of effort or training but of something innate, and the eleven-minute review had been the world's way of telling her she didn't have it.

Her parents had driven her here four years ago in her father's pickup, the one with the rust along the wheel wells. Her mother had packed sandwiches. Her father had carried the boxes up four flights because the elevator was broken, and he had stood in her dorm room and looked around at the cinderblock walls and the narrow bed and he had said, in the matter-of-fact tone of a man who built things for a living: "You're going to do good here, Elenita." He did not say it as a hope. He said it as a measurement, the way he said a wall was level or a joint was tight.

They had called every Sunday for four years. She had not told them about the critique in sophomore year when a classmate said her work looked like "an immigrant's idea of American art" and Lindquist let the comment stand. She had not told them about the nights in the studio until three in the morning, not from inspiration but from fear — the fear of sitting with the silence of being the only person whose parents had not gone to college, the only person who flinched at the price of the oil paints and bought the student-grade acrylics and hoped no one noticed. She had told them she was fine. She had told them, just this morning, that the senior review was a formality.

Now she stood on the roof and thought about calling them. She thought about her mother's voice. She thought about what the phone call would sound like tomorrow, when someone found her number in the registrar's file and dialed it, and the thought did not produce grief or guilt or hesitation. It produced nothing. It landed on the flat surface of the conviction and slid off, the way water slides off stone.

This was the thing that frightened her — not the height, not the wind, not the fall. The nothing. The absence of the feelings that should have stopped her. The emptiness Lindquist had found in her paintings was in her too, had always been in her, and the paintings were just the evidence. *Technically skilled but emotionally vacant.* The diagnosis was total. It covered everything.

<!-- AGENT:NOTE — Emotional state: emptiness, not despair. The danger is the absence of feeling, not its intensity. Coordinates with SITUATIONAL_INTERPRETATION.md re: emotional contamination (shame → withdrawal) -->

The wind picked up. She noticed, with the detached precision of someone cataloging a scene she would not need to remember, that the gravel beneath her feet was a mix of gray and white and rust-colored stones, and that the rust-colored ones were feldspar, pinkish and granular, and that the composition of the gravel against the zinc-colored sky and the aluminum railing had a palette she would have noted in her sketchbook under other circumstances. Cool neutrals with an accent of warm mineral.

She was thinking about color palettes on the roof of a building she intended to step off of, and even this seemed like confirmation — that her brain worked this way, that she could not turn off the compositional eye even now, that she would always be a person who noticed the quality of light while the actual content of her life went unattended.

She looked down again. The courtyard. The pathways. The benches. Four stories.

Then she saw it.

Not immediately. Her eyes passed over it first, the way eyes pass over anything that has been in a landscape long enough to become part of the ground. But something caught — a shape, an interruption in the expected geometry — and her gaze returned the way a hand returns to a rough spot on a smooth surface.

Near the bench closest to the maintenance shed. A small form, set on a concrete base. From four stories up, in the failing light, she could not see details. She could see shape: a vertical figure with one extension reaching upward at something close to forty-five degrees. The proportions were rough. The surface was uneven, catching the last of the light in irregular patches that suggested metal, raw and unfinished. It looked like something that had been assembled rather than sculpted, built from pieces that had once been other things.

Her eye would not leave it. The figure's upward reach. The way the rough surface broke the light into something more interesting than a polished surface would have — shadows pooling in the seams, highlights catching on ridges. From up here it looked like it was straining. Not decoratively. Actually straining, the way a body strains when the effort is real and the outcome is not certain.

Elena took her hands off the railing.

---

Four flights down. The stairwell with its cinder-block walls and industrial cleaner smell, her sneakers on the concrete steps making a sound that was too ordinary for what was happening, which was that she was going down instead of out, going toward something instead of away from everything.

She did not make this decision. That was how she would describe it later — years later, to an interviewer, in a studio filled with the scrap-metal sculptures that had made her name. "I didn't decide to go downstairs. I decided to look at the sculpture. The going downstairs was just what looking at it required."

She pushed through the ground-floor exit and crossed the courtyard. The cold was different down here — closer, wetter, carried in the grass that soaked through her sneakers. The campus lights had come on, the pathway lamps casting orange circles on the pavement.

The sculpture was smaller than it had appeared from above. Eighteen inches, maybe twenty. It sat on a cinder block turned on its side and set into the ground beside the bench. The figure itself was welded scrap metal: rebar, pieces of angle iron, something that might have been part of a bracket or a hinge, all joined with visible weld beads that ran along the seams like raised scars.

It was a human figure, roughly abstracted — torso, legs, and one arm raised above the head, the hand open, fingers splayed, reaching for something that was not depicted. The arm was extended to its full length, the wrist slightly bent as if the effort had torqued it. The body beneath was braced, the legs set wide, the torso tilted back to counterbalance the reach. It looked like a person trying to touch something they were not tall enough to touch. Someone on the last inch of their effort.

The welding was not professional. The beads were uneven — thick in some places, thin in others, with spatter marks where the arc had wandered. Whoever had made this was self-taught. The joints were strong — Elena could see the penetration of the welds, the way the metal had fused rather than merely adhered — but the technique was functional, not decorative. This was not a sculpture made by someone who had studied sculpture. This was a sculpture made by someone who knew how to join metal and had something they needed to say.

She crouched down. The grass was cold and it soaked through her jeans immediately. There, on the front face of the cinder block, scratched into the concrete with something sharp — a nail, maybe, or a flathead screwdriver — two words in block letters, crude and uneven, the scratches filled with dirt that made them legible against the gray:

KEEP GOING

Elena read the words. She reached out and touched the letters with her index finger, tracing the grooves, feeling the rough concrete and the grit of dirt in the scratches. The letters were not deep. They had been made quickly, without revision, the way you write something when the writing is not the point — when the point is what the words say, not how they look on the surface.

<!-- AGENT:NOTE — The sculpture's roughness is the point: art without institutional permission. Coordinates with OVERARCHING_NARRATIVE.md thematic thread (margins, invisible intervention). Zophiel's work is deniable — Elena interprets it as a maintenance worker's creation, which is also true. -->

She placed her palm flat against the figure's torso. The metal was cold — colder than the railing on the roof, a deep cold that felt as if it went through the metal and into the ground, connected to something larger than the November evening. The surface was rough under her hand. She could feel the weld beads, the seams where one piece of scrap had been joined to another, the slight warping where the heat of the torch had pulled the metal out of true. It was imperfect. It was honest. It was the work of someone who had not been taught to hide.

Something moved in her, below the flat surface of the conviction, below the nothing. Not a feeling, exactly. Not yet. More like the ground shifting — a tectonic thing, slow and deep. The nothing cracked. A hairline fracture, thin as a scratch in concrete, and through it came not grief or hope but something smaller: curiosity. Not *why should I live* — that was too large, too abstract, unanswerable on a courtyard lawn at dusk. The question was smaller. *Who made this?*

And behind it: *Why?*

Someone — someone with no audience, no gallery, no degree, no review — had spent hours welding scrap metal into a figure and set it in a corner where no one would see it. Had scratched those two words into the base. Not for Elena specifically — they couldn't have known she would stand on the roof tonight, would look down at this exact corner at this exact moment. They were talking to anyone. To the courtyard, to the bench, to whoever might pass and look down.

They were making art because they needed to make it. Not because a professor had approved it or a gallery would show it or it would appear on a CV. Because the thing inside them that needed to be said could only be said this way — in metal, in welding, in the specific grammar of scrap material joined by heat and pressure into a shape that meant something.

Art did not need permission.

She had heard this before, in different forms. But she had never believed it. She had believed, in the deep, structural way that beliefs form when you are the first in your family to enter a world that was not built for you, that art required validation. That the gate was the thing, and the gatekeeper's opinion was the price of entry.

The sculpture did not believe this. It sat on its cinder block in the corner of a courtyard and reached upward with its one rough arm and said *keep going* and it did not require Elena Vasquez or anyone else to confirm that it was art. It existed because someone had made it, and the making was sufficient.

Elena stood up. Her knees were wet and her fingers were numb and the campus was dark now, and somewhere across the quad the bad guitarist was still playing, the same three chords in the same halting sequence, patient and unashamed.

She was alive. Not because she had decided to live — that decision, the conscious and deliberate choice, would come later, in stages, over weeks and months. But because she had decided not to die yet. Not tonight. The distinction was narrow. It was the width of a hairline crack, the depth of a scratch in concrete, and it was enough.

---

She went back to her room. She turned on the desk lamp. Her twelve pieces leaned against the wall. She looked at them and she saw what Lindquist had seen — the control, the smoothness, the technical skill deployed as armor, every brushstroke calculated to demonstrate competence, every composition designed to prove that she belonged. She had been so afraid of being seen as less than that she had stripped the work of everything that might have been more.

She turned the charcoal series to the wall. Not in anger. In recognition. The way you close a book you have finished, not because it is bad but because it is done.

She sat at her desk. She opened her sketchbook to a blank page. She did not draw. She wrote, in pencil, small and sharp:

*Found materials. Start with what's thrown away. Start with what nobody wants.*

*Keep going.*

She did not know yet what this meant. She did not know that in six months she would drop out of the MFA program she'd been accepted to and take a job at a salvage yard in New Haven, sorting metal, learning the difference between cast iron and wrought iron and tool steel by the sound they made when struck with a hammer. She did not know that she would start welding in the yard's back lot after hours, with permission from a foreman named Sal who watched her work without comment and one evening brought her a better pair of gloves. She did not know that her first real sculpture — built from a car door and a section of chain-link fence and a copper pipe thrown away because it had a bend in it — would sit in her apartment for two years before anyone saw it, and that the first person who saw it would cry, and that the crying would be the first review that mattered.

She did not know that years later, when her name was in galleries and critics wrote sentences about her work, she would go back to Hargrove. She would drive up on a Tuesday in October and find that Whitfield Hall was gone — torn down, replaced by a glass-and-steel residence facility with a name she did not recognize. She would ask at the facilities office about a small welded sculpture, a figure reaching upward, cinder-block base. The man behind the desk would shake his head. They'd cleared everything when they demolished the old building. Donated some things. Scrapped the rest.

*Scrapped the rest.* The sculpture that had saved her life, made from scrap, returned to scrap. She would never find it. She would never learn who made it. The maintenance worker who had welded a figure from scrap metal and scratched *keep going* into the base would remain anonymous, a presence defined entirely by the work they left behind.

But that was later. For now, Elena sat at her desk in a dorm room on the fourth floor of Whitfield Hall, and the lamp made a circle of warm light on the sketchbook, and her hands were cold and her knees were damp and somewhere on the roof the railing she had gripped twenty minutes ago was vibrating in the dark, touched by nothing but weather.

She closed the sketchbook. She put on her coat — the thrift-store peacoat, navy blue, missing one button. She put her hands in the pockets. She walked out of her room and down the four flights and through the lobby and out into the November night.

She walked across the campus and through the parking lot and along the road past the athletic fields, and the cold was sharp and the sky was black and the stars were out — more stars than she had ever seen growing up in Bridgeport — and she walked with her hands in her pockets and her breath making small white clouds that the wind carried away, and she was alive.

The rest could come later. The rest could come tomorrow, or next week, or in the years that stretched ahead of her, which was terrifying and was also, she was beginning to understand, the point. You did not need to see the end. You needed to keep going. Someone had scratched it into concrete and left it in a courtyard, and it was the truest thing she knew.

Elena walked through the dark with her hands in her pockets. Alive. That was enough for now.

<!-- AGENT:NOTE — Chapter closes with Elena in motion, alive, in the dark — echoing the book's pattern of characters walking alone through the aftermath of pivotal moments (cf. Cassiel walking home through Queens at end of Ch. 1). The phrase "keep going" functions as Elena's "try once more" — a found philosophy that will define her arc. The chapter fulfills at least three scene functions: reveals character (Elena's artistic eye, class background, emotional guardedness), develops theme (art as salvation, invisible intervention, making beauty from discards), and advances plot (Elena's near-death and artistic transformation). -->
