# Chapter 37: Second Margins

**September 2030 — Baltimore, Maryland**

---

The coffee maker had to be hit. Not hard — a lateral strike with the heel of the palm, applied to the upper left corner of the housing at approximately the moment the brewing light turned from amber to red. Keisha Williams had calibrated this through months of trial, and she could do it now without looking, the way a pianist can play a passage from muscle memory, the hand moving to the right spot at the right time while her attention was on the intake form in front of her and the woman sitting across the desk who was holding a toddler on one knee and a WIC appointment card in the other hand and was explaining, in the halting, circular way that people explain things when they are ashamed and afraid, that her husband had been sentenced last Thursday and she did not know how to pay the rent.

The coffee maker hissed and began to drip.

"Okay," Keisha said. "Let's start with the rent. How much, and when?"

"Twelve hundred. Due the first."

"That's next week."

"I know."

"Are you working?"

"I'm at the distribution center in Dundalk. Night shift. But the sitter — my husband's mother was watching Jaylen while I worked, and she's — she can't do it now. She's not —" The woman stopped. The toddler on her knee was pulling at the WIC card, and she gently took it back and held both the child and the card against her body as though they were made of the same material, the material of things that could be taken.

"She's not coping," Keisha said.

"No."

"Does she need services too?"

The woman's eyes went wet. She did not blink. She sat in the donated office chair — a swivel chair with one broken caster that listed to the left, requiring the sitter to plant one foot against the floor to stay level — and she held her child and her documentation and she did not blink, because blinking would release what was behind the eyes, and what was behind the eyes could not be released here, in this office, in front of this stranger, because releasing it would mean that the situation was as bad as it felt, and she was not ready to let it be that bad.

Keisha had seen this face a hundred times. She had worn this face. She had been the woman in the chair, and before that she had been the child in the chair, and the continuity between those two positions was the reason she was on this side of the desk instead of the other — not because she had transcended the position but because she had passed through it and come out carrying enough knowledge to be useful.

"We'll sort the rent," Keisha said. "We have an emergency fund. It won't cover all of it, but it'll cover enough to keep you in the apartment while we figure out the rest. And we have a childcare network — three women on our roster who do overnight sits for second-shift parents. It's not free, but it's sliding scale, and for the first month it's covered by our grant."

"I can't —" The woman started, stopped. The sentence she was not saying — *I can't accept charity* — was the same sentence everyone said, the sentence Keisha had said herself at the credit union on North Avenue in 2014 when Denise Hall had slid the check across the desk and the check had been warm from the printer and the amount had been exact.

"You're not accepting charity," Keisha said. "You're accessing a service. There's a difference. Charity is what people give you when they want to feel good about themselves. Services are what people build when they've been where you are and decided nobody should have to be there alone."

The coffee maker beeped. Keisha stood, poured two cups, handed one to the woman. The woman took it. The toddler reached for it. The woman moved it out of range with the reflexive precision of a parent whose body had learned to anticipate the trajectories of small hands.

"Thank you," the woman said.

"Thank me when the rent's paid and the sitter's lined up and you've slept for more than four hours."

The office was a converted storefront on Greenmount Avenue, between a nail salon and a bodega that sold lottery tickets and loose cigarettes and the best Dominican coffee in northeast Baltimore. The storefront had been a cell phone repair shop before Keisha leased it, and before that a check-cashing place, and before that — in its original life, the one recorded on the building permit from 1957 — a barbershop. Keisha had found the original permit while ripping out the drop ceiling her first week and had framed it and hung it by the door, because the building had a history of serving people and she wanted everyone who walked in to know that the serving did not start with her.

The ceiling was still imperfect. She had replaced the drop tiles with painted drywall, but the paint was uneven in places, applied by volunteers who had more enthusiasm than skill, and the light fixture in the back corner had a short that made it flicker when the A/C kicked on. The floor was linoleum, scuffed and cracked, and the cracks had been filled with caulk by DeShawn during a weekend repair session that he had approached with the meticulous attention of a man who had learned in prison that the quality of your work was the only thing you controlled. The walls were covered. Not with professional art — with photographs. Hundreds of them, pinned and taped and thumbtacked to every available surface, photographs of families. Families they had helped. A woman holding a lease. A man in a suit jacket at a job interview, the price tag still visible on the sleeve because Keisha had driven him to Goodwill an hour before and there hadn't been time to remove it. A teenager graduating high school, the cap and gown rented, the smile not rented. Two children in a clean apartment, looking at the camera with the frank, unperforming gaze of children who have stopped being afraid.

The coffee maker was donated. The desk was donated. The chairs were donated. The computer was seven years old and ran with the labored determination of a machine that had been asked to exceed its specifications and was complying under protest. The filing cabinet in the corner had a dent in the bottom drawer where Keisha had kicked it the night the first grant application was rejected, a dent she had never fixed because it reminded her that anger was a resource and that the question was not whether you felt it but what you did with it.

DeShawn was at the intake table in the front of the office, where the plate glass window let in the Greenmount Avenue light — car headlights, streetlights, the red and blue of the liquor store sign across the street, and on clear mornings, actual sunlight that made the dust motes visible and gave the room the quality of a space where things were alive and moving even when no one was speaking. He was twenty-three now. He had his mother's jawline and his father's height and the particular stillness of a man who had learned to be still in a place where movement attracted attention, though the stillness had softened since his release, had lost its coiled quality and become something closer to patience. He wore a polo shirt — Second Margins embroidered on the pocket, a design Keisha had commissioned from a teenager in their GED program — and he was typing with two fingers because he had never learned to type properly and refused Keisha's offer of a class on the grounds that two fingers had gotten him this far.

His daughter was in the corner of the office, where a play area had been set up with a rug from IKEA and a box of donated toys and a small bookshelf that contained, in no particular order, *Goodnight Moon*, *The Very Hungry Caterpillar*, a water-stained copy of *Where the Wild Things Are*, three coloring books, and a medical textbook on basic anatomy that had been donated by accident and that the child had claimed with the territorial ferocity of a five-year-old who had found a book with pictures of skeletons in it and was not giving it back.

Her name was Cassiel.

Cassiel Williams was five years old, and she had been named by her mother — DeShawn's girlfriend, a woman named Tamika who worked the evening shift at a nursing home in Towson and who had heard the name in a dream the week before the baby was born and had liked the sound of it without knowing what it meant, without knowing that it was the name of an angel, without knowing that the angel it belonged to had once sat in a hospital waiting room in Queens while a doctor saved a woman who set in motion a chain that would, forty-five years later, bring that angel's namesake into the world in a row house on Edmondson Avenue while Keisha Williams held Tamika's hand and counted the contractions and thought, without knowing why, that the name sounded right.

Cassiel did not know she was named after an angel. She knew she had a name that nobody else at her daycare had, which she liked, and she knew that the name had three syllables, which she could count on her fingers, and she knew that her grandmother said the name with a particular warmth that she did not use for other words, a warmth that Cassiel could feel in her chest even though she could not have explained it any more than she could have explained gravity or photosynthesis or the reason the sky was blue — things that existed because they existed, explanations that would come later, when her mind had grown large enough to hold them.

She was in the corner now, drawing. She drew constantly. She drew with the intensity of a child for whom the crayon was not a toy but an instrument, a tool for recording the things she saw, and what she saw — this was the thing that Keisha noticed, that Keisha watched with the attention of a grandmother who had spent a lifetime learning to recognize the small signs that indicated which way a life was going to tip — was people. Not houses, not flowers, not the sun with rays coming off it like a cartoon explosion. People. She drew the people in the office. She drew them with a specificity that was startling for a five-year-old — DeShawn with his two-finger typing, Keisha with her coffee, the woman in the intake chair with the toddler, the mail carrier who came at eleven and always said *good morning, little queen* and whose mail bag Cassiel had drawn with careful attention to the strap and the buckle and the way it hung against his hip.

She drew the connections between them. Lines, in different colors, running from person to person. When Keisha had asked her what the lines were, Cassiel had said, "That's how they know each other," and Keisha had looked at the drawing — at the web of colored lines connecting the figures, each one drawn with the deliberate, straight-armed concentration of a child who understood, in the wordless way that children understand things, that people were not separate but linked, that the office was not a room full of individuals but a network, a fabric, a thing that held together because each thread was connected to the others — and Keisha had put the drawing on the wall with the photographs and had not been able to explain, even to herself, why looking at it made her throat tight.

---

The new volunteer arrived at ten.

She gave her name as Meg. She was in her early thirties, thin in a way that spoke less of diet and more of appetite lost, the thinness of a person whose body had forgotten how to want food because the mind was too full of something else. She wore jeans and a sweater that was too warm for September, and her hair was pulled back in a ponytail that looked like it had been assembled quickly, without a mirror, the kind of ponytail you make when you need your hair out of your face because the face is doing important work.

Keisha met her at the door. She always met new volunteers at the door, because the door was the threshold and the threshold mattered — it was the place where the street became the office, where public became private, where the person walking in made the transition from someone passing by to someone choosing to enter.

"Meg?" Keisha extended her hand. "I'm Keisha. Welcome to Second Margins."

The woman took her hand. Her grip was firm but brief, the handshake of someone who had learned to perform normal physical contact but who found it effortful, as if the act of touching another person required a small, private calculation — *this is what people do, this is how they do it, I can do this* — before the hand could move.

"Thank you for having me. I saw the posting at the community center."

"We're glad you're here. We always need help. Let me show you around."

The tour took five minutes because the office was not large enough to require more. Intake desk. Filing cabinet. Coffee maker (Keisha demonstrated the striking technique; Meg's mouth twitched, which was not a smile but was adjacent to one). Bathroom, through the back, the door that stuck and had to be shouldered open. The play area where Cassiel sat drawing, glancing up briefly at the new person with the assessing gaze of a child who was determining whether this adult was interesting, deciding that she was, and returning to her drawing.

"We do intake three days a week," Keisha said. "Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays. People come in with whatever they've got — could be an eviction notice, could be a parole question, could be they just need someone to help them fill out a form. We're not lawyers. We're not social workers, technically, though I've got the license. We're the place you come to when you don't know where else to go."

Meg nodded. She was looking at the photographs on the wall with an expression that Keisha recognized — the expression of someone seeing evidence that other people had survived the thing she was trying to survive, the visual proof that the path she was on had been walked by others and that some of them had come out the other side.

"You work with families of incarcerated people?" Meg asked.

"Mostly. That's how we started. But we take anyone. The margin between stable and not stable doesn't check your paperwork."

"The margin."

"That's what I call it. The margin. The space between the life you've got and the life you're about to lose. Some people, that margin is wide — they've got savings, they've got family, they've got a cushion. Other people, it's this thin." Keisha held her thumb and forefinger a hair's width apart. "A car that won't start. A bill that's twenty dollars more than they expected. A phone call they didn't want to get. That's who we're for. The people on the thin margin."

Meg was quiet. She stood in the office with her hands in the pockets of her too-warm sweater, and her eyes moved from the photographs to the play area where Cassiel was drawing to the intake desk where DeShawn was typing to the coffee maker that had to be struck and the filing cabinet with the dent and the ceiling with its uneven paint, and Keisha watched her take it in, watched the woman register the imperfection of the place and the purpose behind the imperfection, the fact that this office existed not because someone had money or a vision or a grant but because someone had needed it and someone else had built it and the building was ongoing, was never finished, was held together by the same adhesive that held together every life Keisha had ever known: persistence, and coffee, and the willingness to hit the machine until it worked.

"I'd like to help," Meg said.

"Then you're in the right place."

---

Meg was good at the work.

This surprised Keisha, because most new volunteers were not good at the work — not because they lacked compassion or competence, but because the work required a specific kind of presence, a way of sitting with someone in their worst moment without trying to fix it, without offering the reflexive *it'll be okay* that people deployed when they could not tolerate another person's pain. Most volunteers learned this over time. Some never did. Some left after the first week, overwhelmed by the density of need that walked through the door on a Tuesday afternoon, by the accumulation of stories that were different in their details and identical in their architecture — the lost job, the absent partner, the bill that tipped the balance, the child who needed things the parent could not provide.

Meg did not try to fix. She sat with. She listened with a quality of attention that was almost physical, as though the act of listening were a thing her body did, not just her ears. She took notes in a small hand, precise, the writing of someone who had been trained or had trained herself in documentation. She did not flinch at the stories. She did not cry, or look away, or offer platitudes. She sat in the donated chair and she listened and when the person across from her had finished talking she said, simply, "What do you need?" and the simplicity of the question — its lack of judgment, its assumption that the person knew what they needed and deserved to be asked — did something to the people she sat with, opened something in them, the way a simple question can open a door that a hundred complicated ones cannot.

She came three times a week. Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays. She arrived at ten and left at four and she did not talk about herself. Keisha did not push. She had learned, across three years of running Second Margins, that volunteers came to the work for their own reasons and that those reasons were not always ready to be spoken, that sometimes a person needed to do the work for weeks or months before the doing loosened whatever was bound inside them enough for it to come out.

But she watched. She watched the way she watched everything — with the attention of a woman who had spent a lifetime on the thin margin and who had learned to read people as she read bills, carefully, looking for the number that didn't add up.

Meg was carrying something. The weight of it was in her shoulders, in the way she held herself — slightly hunched, slightly guarded, the posture of someone who was trying to take up less space, as though the act of existing at normal dimensions were an imposition she could not quite justify. She was efficient and warm with the families and quiet and contracted in the moments between, and the contrast was sharp enough that Keisha noticed it the way a mechanic notices a sound in an engine — not the sound itself but the gap between the sound and what the engine should sound like, the difference between what was and what should be.

In the third week, Keisha found Meg in the bathroom. Not using it — sitting on the closed lid of the toilet with her face in her hands, breathing in the shallow, rapid way that Keisha recognized because she had breathed that way herself, in the hallway of her apartment at three in the morning after walking home from Towson in the cold, in the parking lot of the credit union after signing the loan papers, in the break room of the grocery store after giving back the seven dollars. The breathing of someone whose body was processing something the mind could not hold.

Keisha did not say anything. She closed the bathroom door behind her. She leaned against it. She waited.

Meg took her hands from her face. Her eyes were red and dry — she had not been crying, or she had been crying the dry kind, the kind where the body goes through the mechanics of grief without producing tears, as if the system had run out of the material grief required.

"Sorry," Meg said.

"Don't be."

"I just need a minute."

"Take as many as you need. The coffee maker doesn't work without me anyway."

Meg almost laughed. The sound that came out was closer to a cough — a small convulsion of the chest that was trying to be humor and was not quite succeeding but was trying, which was the thing that mattered, the trying.

"Some days I don't believe I deserve to help anyone," Meg said.

The sentence sat in the bathroom, which was small and smelled of the lavender air freshener Keisha had hung from the towel rack and, beneath the lavender, the deeper institutional smell of old pipes and floor cleaner. Keisha looked at Meg. She looked at the way the woman held herself, hunched on the toilet seat in a bathroom that was barely large enough for two people, and she saw the thing she had seen from the beginning but had not named — the weight, the carried thing, the burden that was too specific and too heavy to be the ordinary grief of a person who had come to the work because they wanted to do good. This was something else. This was guilt so dense it had its own gravity, and the woman was orbiting it, held in place by a force she could not escape and could not name.

Keisha did not ask what the guilt was about. She did not need to know. She had learned — from Denise Hall at the credit union, from Mrs. Paulette on the porch, from Gabriel's support groups that she had never attended but whose philosophy she had absorbed through the ambient kindness of people who had been touched by them — that the specific content of a person's pain was less important than the fact that they were in it and that someone was willing to be in it with them.

"Deserving isn't the point," Keisha said. "Showing up is."

She had said this before. She had said it to DeShawn, in the visiting room at Jessup, through the plexiglass that smelled of disinfectant and the accumulated breath of a thousand difficult conversations. She had said it to the first family that walked through the door of Second Margins, the young woman with the toddler and the eviction notice, when Keisha sat her down and said *let's see what we can do*. She had said it to herself, at the kitchen table on Edmondson Avenue, at 5:14 in the morning, before the alarm, in the dark, in the cold apartment with the thermostat set at sixty-two, when the math didn't work and the bills were spread like a losing hand and the only thing that kept her moving was the decision to move.

The sentence had become her philosophy. Not in the way philosophies are written in books — not articulated, not defended, not arrived at through argument. In the way philosophies are built in kitchens and prisons and bathrooms and all the places where the formal language of ethics has no purchase and what's left is just the thing you know because you've lived it. Deserving was a trap. Deserving was the voice that said *you haven't earned this* or *you're not good enough for this* or *who are you to help anyone when you couldn't even help yourself*. Deserving was the locked door. Showing up was the act of standing in front of the locked door and doing the work anyway, not because you had a key but because the door was where you were and turning away was the only thing worse than standing there.

Meg looked at her. The red eyes, the dry face, the hands that had been covering it now in her lap, open, palms up, the posture of someone who had stopped holding.

"Okay," Meg said.

"Okay."

"Can I — can I go back to the desk?"

"The desk isn't going anywhere."

Meg stood. She was taller than Keisha — most people were; Keisha was five foot three and had stopped apologizing for it around the same time she stopped apologizing for everything else — and in the small bathroom the height difference was magnified, Meg looking down at Keisha who was leaning against the door with her arms crossed and her face set in the expression that her children called her *mama bear face* — not angry, not soft, just present, fully occupying the space she was in, taking up exactly the room she needed.

"Thank you," Meg said.

"Go do intake. Mrs. Henderson is waiting and she gets cranky when her appointment's late."

Meg went.

Keisha stood in the bathroom for a moment after the door closed. She looked at the lavender air freshener. She looked at the caulk around the base of the toilet that DeShawn had applied and that was already beginning to yellow. She breathed.

She did not know that the woman she had just spoken to was the sister of the boy who had walked into a school three years ago and fired a gun seven times. She did not know that the boy had been sixteen and that three people had died and that the sister, who had been twenty-eight then, had changed her name and moved to Baltimore and spent two years not leaving her apartment before a support group for families of perpetrators — a group facilitated by a man who had introduced himself as Aaron, who was tall and weeping and who had told her, with an honesty so stark it had felt like an act of violence, that he too had failed someone he was supposed to protect — had given her enough oxygen to stand up. She did not know that Meg's real name was something else, that the identity she carried into this office was constructed the way a cast is constructed around a broken bone, holding the damaged thing in place while it healed.

She did not know any of this. She knew that a woman named Meg came to the office three times a week and sat with families and listened with the kind of attention that could not be taught and that she carried a weight she could not yet name and that, in a bathroom on Greenmount Avenue, she had said *I don't believe I deserve to help anyone* and Keisha had said the truest thing she knew.

That was enough.

In the afternoon, Cassiel brought Meg a drawing.

The office was quiet — the Tuesday rush had subsided, the last family had left at two-thirty, and the space had settled into the stillness of a room that had been full of voices and was now full of their resonance, the way a church feels after a service, not empty but inhabited by the memory of what had happened. DeShawn was at the intake table, updating files. Keisha was in the back, on the phone with the grant coordinator from the Baltimore Community Foundation, explaining for the third time that the line item for office supplies included the coffee maker and that the coffee maker was, in fact, essential to operations, a claim she was prepared to defend with the passion of a woman for whom coffee was not a beverage but an infrastructure category.

Cassiel crossed the office with the drawing held in front of her, extended at arm's length, the way children present things they have made — not with shyness but with the sovereign confidence of a creator who has produced something and is delivering it to its intended recipient. She stopped in front of Meg, who was sitting at the intake desk filling out end-of-day reports in her small, precise hand.

"This is for you," Cassiel said.

Meg looked at the drawing. Her hand, which had been writing, stopped.

It was a picture of the office. Not a five-year-old's approximation of the office — or, it was that, it was crayons on paper and the proportions were wrong and the people were larger than the furniture and the coffee maker was the size of a person — but it was the office in the way that mattered — a map is a place even though it is not the place. There was the window with the Greenmount Avenue light. There was the desk with the dent. There was DeShawn at the table. There was Keisha with her coffee. There was the wall of photographs. And there, at the intake desk, sitting in the donated chair, was a figure that was Meg — or Meg as seen by a five-year-old, which was Meg stripped of the guarding and the hunching and the too-warm sweater and rendered as a person, simply a person, among other people, connected to them by the colored lines that Cassiel drew between everyone, the lines that meant *this is how they know each other*.

Meg looked at it. She looked at it for a long time. The reports were forgotten. Her hand was still, the pen resting on the paper, and she looked at the drawing with the expression of someone who had been given something they did not know they were missing, something so simple and so direct that the sophistication of adult grief had no defense against it.

The lines connected Meg to DeShawn. To Keisha. To the families on the wall. To the coffee maker. To the window and the light. To the child who had drawn her.

Meg's eyes filled. The tears came this time — not the dry convulsion of the bathroom but the real thing, the salt water, the release. They ran down her face and she did not wipe them and she did not look away from the drawing and the tears landed on the intake reports and blurred the ink, and she did not care about the ink.

Cassiel did not understand why the woman was crying. She understood that the woman was crying, and she understood, in the way that children understand things before they have the language for them, that the crying was not a problem to be solved but a thing to be accompanied. She climbed onto the chair next to Meg's chair. She sat. She reached over and put her small hand on Meg's hand, the one that was not holding the drawing, and she held it.

They sat like that for a while. The office was quiet. DeShawn looked over, saw, and looked away — the looking away not a lack of attention but a granting of privacy, the kind of seeing that manifests as not-seeing, the courtesy of people who have lived in close quarters and understand that some moments belong only to the people inside them.

Meg held the drawing. Cassiel held her hand. The afternoon light from Greenmount Avenue came through the plate glass window and made the dust motes visible, turning them into a slow, silent weather system of golden particles, and in that light the office looked — not beautiful, exactly. It was too imperfect for beauty. The caulk was yellowing and the coffee maker was temperamental and the filing cabinet was dented and the chairs did not match. But it looked like something. It looked like the thing Keisha had built it to look like, which was not an office but an answer to the question of what you did when the margin was thin and the math didn't work and the only thing between the life you had and the life you were about to lose was a person willing to sit with you and say *let's see what we can do*.

---

Keisha locked up at six.

The day's paperwork was filed. The coffee maker was unplugged — a necessity, not a choice; the wiring was old and the insurance didn't cover electrical fires, a fact Keisha had learned from the adjuster who had inspected the space and who had delivered this information with the cheerfulness of a man whose job was to explain the ways things could go wrong. DeShawn had taken Cassiel home at five — Tamika's shift started at six, and the handoff was precise, choreographed, the logistics of a two-parent household where both parents worked and the child's care was a relay race that required the baton to be passed without dropping.

Keisha turned off the lights. The office settled into darkness, the photographs on the wall becoming shadows of photographs, the desk a dark rectangle, the filing cabinet a darker one. The only light came from Greenmount Avenue through the plate glass — the neon of the liquor store, the headlights of passing cars, the orange glow of the streetlight on the corner that had been replaced last year after flickering for six months, a replacement Keisha had personally petitioned the city for through fourteen phone calls and two in-person visits to the Department of Public Works, a campaign she had waged with the grim persistence of a woman who understood that functioning streetlights were not a luxury but a safety issue and that the difference between a lit corner and a dark corner was, in this neighborhood, a margin as thin as any she worked with in the office.

She stood in the dark for a moment. She did this every night. Not a ritual — or, it was a ritual, but not a deliberate one, not a thing she had chosen to do so much as a thing she found herself doing, the way you find yourself pausing at a doorway before you leave a room, taking a last look, confirming that everything is where it should be. The office was where it should be. It would be here tomorrow. The photographs would be on the wall. The coffee maker would need to be struck. The families would come.

She had built this. Not alone — DeShawn had done the caulk and the painting and the intake interviews, and Tamika had designed the logo, and Mrs. Paulette, who was eighty-four now and who still sat on her porch on Poplar Grove Street and who had come to the opening of Second Margins three years ago in a hat that looked like it had been designed for a royal wedding, had supplied the first month's coffee and the business cards that were still stacked on the intake desk. But Keisha had built the frame. She had taken the seed that Denise Hall had planted in her at the credit union — *you'd be good at this work* — and she had tended it through night classes and study groups and a bachelor's degree at forty-one and a social work certificate at forty-three, and she had opened this door and said *come in* and people had come.

She locked the door. She stepped onto Greenmount Avenue.

The evening was warm, the Baltimore September that felt like August refusing to leave — humid, close, the air thick with the smell of asphalt and cooking food and the particular green smell of the ailanthus trees that grew in every crack the city offered, the trees that could not be killed, that grew from concrete and brick and the gaps between, the trees that Keisha's mother had called *ghetto palms* with a mixture of disdain and affection, because they were ugly and unkillable and they were here.

She walked to her car. It was parked on the street, two blocks down, a gray Honda Accord with 147,000 miles and an engine that ran clean because David maintained it. David Okonkwo, who ran the auto school on Moravia Road, who fixed the cars of Second Margins families at cost and sometimes at no cost and who had told Keisha, when she protested, that the work was the payment and that he had learned this from a woman who had given him a chance when he didn't deserve one and that the woman was standing in front of him arguing about an oil change.

She had stopped arguing about the oil changes. She had sent him six referrals instead, families whose teenagers needed something to do and whose cars needed something fixed, and David had taken them all, because David took everyone, because David's auto school was its own version of Second Margins — a place where the margin between who you were and who you could be was measured in engine blocks and torque wrenches and the patience of a man who had been where you were and had come out the other side carrying a skill and a willingness to teach it.

Keisha got in the car. The engine turned over on the first try, which still felt like a gift, even after three years of reliable starting, even after three years of a car that did what a car was supposed to do. She could remember the other cars — the ones that didn't start, the ones that required a jump from Darius the neighbor's son, the ones whose batteries died on Thursday nights in January and sent her walking 4.7 miles to Towson in the cold. She could remember them the way you remember illness — not with longing, not with nostalgia, but with the sharp, physical awareness that the present was better and that the distance between the present and the past was not wide and was not guaranteed.

She drove. Greenmount to North Avenue. North Avenue to Edmondson. The route took her through the geography of her own life, past the credit union where Denise Hall had told her she'd be good at this work, past the corner where the Food Fair used to be before it closed in 2021, past the church where her grandmother had sung and where Keisha had attended the memorial for DeShawn's father — not a funeral, because the body had been buried in the prison cemetery, but a memorial, held in the church basement with folding chairs and a photograph and a silence that lasted longer than the prayers.

She turned onto Ashland Avenue. Past the row houses that stood shoulder to shoulder the way they had for fifty years and would for fifty more. Past the Patterson place, where the boy with the broken shoes had lived, the boy she had given five dollars to when she was nine. She wondered about that boy sometimes. Whether the five dollars had been enough for shoes. Whether the shoes had lasted. Whether the boy had grown into a man who remembered a girl on the sidewalk who had handed him money she didn't have for a reason she couldn't explain.

She drove past the corner where she had found the twenty-dollar bill.

She did not stop. She never stopped. But she touched the steering wheel a little tighter, the way you touch a railing when you pass a place where you almost fell, the tactile confirmation that you are still here, still moving, still holding on. The twenty dollars. The dry bill on the damp sidewalk, clean and folded, as though someone had placed it there on purpose. She had been nine. She had given five of it away and bought milk and eggs and bread and peanut butter with the rest, and her mother had cried in the kitchen chair, and Keisha had not understood the crying then but she understood it now, because she was a mother and a grandmother and a woman who had built a thing from nothing and who cried sometimes in her own kitchen at the things her children did, at the quiet, unannounced goodness of people who had been given very little and who gave it anyway.

The rowhouse was still there. The streetlight was still there. The sidewalk was cracked in the same places it had been cracked when she was nine, though the cracks were wider now, the concrete slowly separating, the way all things slowly separate under pressure and weather and time.

She drove home. The apartment was quiet — DeShawn and Tamika had taken Cassiel to Tamika's mother's house for dinner, a weekly arrangement that gave Keisha the one thing she had never had enough of and still did not know how to use: an evening alone. She heated leftover soup. She sat at the kitchen table. She ate.

The table was different now — not the card table from the Edmondson Avenue apartment, the one where she had spread the bills and circled the number $340 and done the math that never worked. This table was solid. Oak, secondhand, bought from a thrift store in Hampden with the first paycheck from Second Margins. It had a scratch on the surface from Cassiel's crayon, a deep groove in the wood that Keisha had considered sanding and then decided to leave, because the scratch was evidence that a child lived here and that the child was making things and that the things she made left marks, which was what things were supposed to do.

She washed the bowl. She set her alarm. Not for 5:14 — that number belonged to a different life, a different architecture, a time when the margin between functional and falling apart was measured in minutes and the loss of a single one could bring the whole structure down. She set it for six-thirty, which was the time of a life that had a little room in it, a life where the margin was wider, where the cushion existed, where the bus route to work was short and the car started and the rent was paid and the number circled on the legal pad was zero.

She lay in bed. The apartment was warm. The ceiling had no crack in it, no river-shaped line to stare at in the dark, just smooth plaster, freshly painted, the paint applied by DeShawn who had learned to paint in prison and who painted the way he did everything now — carefully, thoroughly, as if the quality of the surface were a message to the person who would look at it.

Keisha closed her eyes. She thought about Meg in the bathroom, the dry eyes, the sentence about deserving. She thought about Cassiel's drawing, the colored lines connecting everyone. She thought about the woman with the toddler, the rent due next week, the WIC card held like a talisman. She thought about Denise Hall saying *you'd be good at this work* and the seed sitting in cold soil for thirteen years before it grew.

She thought about the twenty-dollar bill on the sidewalk and the boy with the broken shoes and her father's hand on her head and the green aftershave and the red car pulling away from the curb and the morning she sat in the kitchen and ate Cheerios with water because the milk was gone.

She did not think about these things with sadness. She thought about them the way you think about the weather in a place you used to live — with recognition, with the body's memory of what the cold felt like, but without the cold itself. The cold was gone. What remained was the knowledge that she had been in it and had come through it and that the coming-through had made her into the person who could sit across a desk from a woman with a toddler and an eviction notice and say *let's see what we can do* and mean it, because she had been that woman, and before that she had been that woman's daughter, and the line between the two positions was not a line but a bridge, and the bridge was built from twenty-dollar bills found on sidewalks and five-dollar gifts to strangers and terrible coffee and 4.7-mile walks in the cold and the willingness to keep showing up on the days when showing up was the only thing left.

She fell asleep. The apartment was quiet. Outside, the city did what it always did — breathed its breath of exhaust and cooking grease and the ailanthus trees that grew from every crack, and the row houses on Ashland Avenue stood shoulder to shoulder in the dark, and somewhere a child named Cassiel was eating dinner at a table where her grandmother was not present, drawing the people she loved with colored lines between them, connecting them all.
