# Chapter 17: The Abstention

**New York City — October 2019**

---

The photographs were in the bottom drawer of his desk, beneath a stack of appropriations reports and a folder labeled CONFIDENTIAL that contained nothing confidential — just the minutes from a zoning subcommittee meeting he'd been too drunk to attend. Thomas Reed kept them there because he knew no one would look. His staff didn't open that drawer. His chief of staff filed everything digitally now. The bottom drawer was a graveyard of old paper, and the photographs lived among the dead.

He pulled the drawer open at 9:47 p.m., three hours before the vote. The City Hall corridor was quiet. His office — corner office, fourth floor, the one with the window that looked out on Centre Street and the municipal parking garage — smelled of carpet cleaner and the remains of a turkey sandwich he'd eaten at his desk six hours ago. The sandwich sat on a paper plate near the phone, half-finished, the bread gone stale and curling at the edges. He should throw it away. He did not throw it away.

The first photograph was from 1994. A community center in the Bronx, Tremont Avenue, the kind of place that survived on donated folding chairs and optimism. Thomas at twenty-four, in a suit he'd bought at a Goodwill on Fordham Road because he couldn't afford retail on a public defender's salary. He was grinning. The grin was so wide it distorted his face, made him look younger than twenty-four, made him look like a kid who had just won something. Behind him, a banner on the wall read BRONX LEGAL AID — COMMUNITY JUSTICE DAY. To his right, half-cut off by the frame, a seventeen-year-old boy named Jerome stood with his hands in his pockets and an expression of cautious disbelief, as if he had been told something good was happening to him and was waiting for the correction.

Thomas had gotten Jerome's sentence reduced. Aggravated assault — the kid had hit a man outside a bodega with a two-by-four after the man threatened his sister. The prosecution wanted five years. Thomas had argued for probation, community service, anger management counseling. He'd spent forty hours on the case, unpaid, because his supervisor told him it was a loser and Thomas had believed, with the full-throated certainty of a twenty-four-year-old who had just passed the bar, that no case was a loser if the kid had a chance.

The judge gave Jerome two years, suspended. Thomas had cried in the courthouse bathroom. He didn't know if they were tears of victory or frustration — two years suspended was better than five served, but it wasn't probation, wasn't the thing he'd asked for. His supervisor said: *Take the win, Reed.* And Thomas had taken the win, and the photograph, and the feeling — the physical feeling, in his chest, like a fist unclenching — of having stood between a boy and the machinery of the state and having bent the machinery, just slightly, in the direction of mercy.

He set the photograph on the desk. His hands were not steady. They had not been steady for some time — three, four years, maybe longer, a tremor that appeared in the evenings and worsened with alcohol and the particular kind of exhaustion that came from spending your days negotiating with people who wanted things from you that cost you nothing to give because you had already given away everything that mattered.

The second photograph: his wedding, 2001. Sandra in a dress she'd sewn herself because they were still not wealthy then, because his salary as an assistant district attorney was modest and her salary as a teacher was worse, and they had both believed that modesty was a kind of integrity. She was laughing in the photograph, her head thrown back, one hand on his chest. He could not remember what she'd been laughing at. He could remember the weight of her hand.

The ring had been a thin gold band, ninety dollars from a jeweler on Canal Street. He'd worn it for sixteen years. He'd stopped wearing it two years ago, not because Sandra had left — she'd left four years ago — but because the ring had begun to feel accusatory, a small cold weight on his finger that asked questions he did not want to answer. The ring was in a box on his nightstand. He saw it every morning. He did not put it on.

The third photograph: his daughter, Sophie, age five, at Coney Island. A Sunday in July. She was holding a cone of cotton candy roughly the size of her head, and she was laughing with the same thrown-back joy as her mother in the wedding photograph, and behind her the Cyclone was a white skeleton against a sky so blue it looked manufactured. Thomas had taken the day off work — a rare thing, even then — and they had ridden the Wonder Wheel three times because Sophie had said *again, Daddy, again* and he had been unable to say no.

Sophie was thirty now. She had not spoken to him in three years. Not since the story broke — the first story, the smaller one, the real estate developer and the rezoning of a block in Flatbush that had displaced forty-seven families to make room for a mixed-use development that was, in the language of the press release Thomas had helped write, "revitalizing the neighborhood." Sophie had called him the night the story ran. She had said: *Is it true?* He had said: *It's complicated.* She had said: *Dad, is it true.* He had said nothing. She had hung up.

Three years.

He looked at the cotton candy photograph. At the blue sky. At the girl who had said *again, Daddy, again.*

---

The phone on his desk rang at 10:14 p.m. He almost didn't answer. The caller ID showed a New Jersey number he did not recognize, and Thomas had learned to be cautious about unfamiliar numbers — reporters used burners, informants used burners, the developers used burners when they didn't want the call logged. He let it ring four times. Five. His hand moved on its own.

"Hello?"

Silence. Then breathing. Then a voice he knew as well as his own, because it had come from him, because it was half Sandra and half himself, the voice of a woman he had made and failed.

"Dad."

Thomas sat down. He was already sitting, but something inside him sat down — some structural thing that had been holding him upright gave way, and he sank deeper into the chair, and the leather creaked, and the sound was very loud in the empty office.

"Sophie."

"I'm getting married." Her voice was flat. Not cold, exactly — controlled. The voice of a woman who had rehearsed what she was going to say and was now saying it with the careful precision of someone defusing a bomb. "His name is Ben. He's a — it doesn't matter. I'm getting married, and I want you there."

Thomas opened his mouth. What came out was air, not words. He tried again. "Soph — "

"I'm not — this isn't a reconciliation. This isn't me saying everything's fine. Everything's not fine. But I'm getting married, and I want my father at my wedding, and you're my father, and — "

She stopped. The silence on the line had weight. Thomas could hear her breathing — slightly fast, slightly ragged, the breathing of someone who was holding herself together through an act of will.

"I want you there," she said again. Quieter.

"Sophie, I — "

"I have to go. The wedding's in March. I'll send the details."

The line went dead.

Thomas sat with the phone pressed to his ear for a long time after the call ended, listening to the dial tone, which was not a tone so much as an absence, the sound of a connection that had existed and no longer did. His hand, the one not holding the phone, was on the desk next to the photograph of the girl at Coney Island, and the tremor in his fingers made the desk vibrate faintly, a small seismic event that no one would ever measure.

He set the phone down. He looked at the three photographs arranged on his desk: the young man in the borrowed suit, the bride with her hand on his chest, the girl with cotton candy against an impossible sky. Three versions of a life he could still recognize. Three windows into rooms he had locked and lost the key to, or — worse — had kept the key to and chosen not to enter.

The vote was in ninety minutes.

---

He walked to the council chamber at 11:30 p.m. The corridor smelled of floor polish and the faintly metallic scent of old radiators. City Hall at night was a different building — the daytime noise of clerks and lobbyists and constituent phone calls replaced by silence and the low hum of HVAC systems cycling air through rooms that didn't need it. His footsteps echoed. He was wearing the same navy suit he'd worn all day, the tie loosened, the jacket unbuttoned. He needed a shave. He needed a haircut. He needed to not be the person walking this corridor toward this vote.

The council chamber was a high-ceilinged room with oak paneling that had been installed in 1903 and refinished three times since, the wood darkened to the color of strong tea. Twenty-one desks arranged in a semicircle, each with a nameplate and a microphone and a small green lamp that made everyone look slightly ill. The public gallery held forty seats on a raised platform behind a brass railing, and tonight every seat was full.

Thomas paused in the doorway and counted. On the left side of the gallery: the developer, Gerald Whitfield, in a charcoal suit that cost more than Thomas's car, flanked by two attorneys whose names Thomas knew because they had written the language of the resolution Thomas was about to vote on. Whitfield sat with the practiced stillness of a man who had bought what he needed and was waiting for delivery. He did not look at Thomas. He did not need to. The transaction was complete.

On the right side of the gallery, spilling into the center and pressed against the brass railing, the families. Thomas had been told there were sixty-three of them tonight, though he had not counted — residents of the four blocks between Atlantic and Pacific, the ones who lived in the rent-stabilized buildings that Whitfield's development would demolish. They were here because the resolution would rezone their blocks from residential to mixed-use commercial, which sounded neutral, which sounded like policy, which was in fact the legal instrument that would erase their homes.

He looked at them. An older woman in a headscarf, sitting very straight, her hands folded in her lap. A man in a construction vest who must have come directly from a job site. Two teenagers, a boy and a girl, the girl holding a sign she'd made from posterboard: OUR HOME IS NOT YOUR PROFIT. A young family — mother, father, a child of maybe three asleep against the mother's shoulder, the child's face slack and perfect in the way that sleeping children's faces are always perfect, untouched by the room and its machinery.

Two thousand families. That was the number in the impact assessment, the document Thomas had read once and filed and tried not to think about. Two thousand families across four blocks, including elderly tenants who had lived there for thirty years, including families with children in the local schools, including — according to a community organizer who had tried to meet with Thomas three times and been turned away by his chief of staff each time — a mosque, a community garden, and a senior center that served hot meals to forty people a day.

The developer had paid Thomas $87,000 over two years, routed through a consulting firm that existed only on paper. Thomas knew the exact number because he had counted it, the way a man counts the pills in a bottle, the way a man takes inventory of his own destruction. Eighty-seven thousand dollars. Spread across the two thousand families, that was $43.50 per family. The price of displacement, divided and rendered absurd.

He walked to his desk. Councilwoman Alvarez, two seats to his left, glanced at him and then looked away. She would vote no. She always voted no on zoning changes, and she was always outnumbered, and the steadiness of her opposition had made her irrelevant in the way that consistent virtue often becomes irrelevant in rooms where outcomes are decided before the vote is called.

Thomas sat down. The green lamp made his hands look jaundiced. He looked at his hands. The bare ring finger. The tremor.

---

The debate lasted forty minutes. Thomas did not listen. He had read the resolution — he had helped draft parts of it, had sat in a room with Whitfield's attorneys and negotiated the language that would make the displacement sound like progress. He knew the arguments. He knew the counterarguments. He knew the rebuttals to the counterarguments and the rebuttals to the rebuttals, the whole layered architecture of justification that municipal politics erected around its worst decisions, the way language could be shaped to make anything sound reasonable.

He thought about Jerome.

He had not thought about Jerome in years — five, maybe ten. Jerome, who had stood in the Tremont community center with his hands in his pockets, looking like a boy who couldn't believe his luck had turned. Thomas had lost track of him. That was what happened — you saved someone, or you tried to save someone, and then the current of your life carried you past them, and they became a photograph in a drawer, a story you told at parties, a credential: *I used to be a public defender, I cared about people.* Thomas had told that story for twenty years. He'd told it to Sandra when they were dating. He'd told it at fundraising dinners. He'd told it to himself, late at night, when the weight of what he'd become pressed against his chest and he needed to believe that the man he'd been was still in there somewhere, buried but intact.

He wondered what had happened to Jerome. Whether Jerome had stayed out of trouble. Whether the suspended sentence had held, whether the anger management had worked, whether the kid with the two-by-four and the sister had built a life.

He did not know that Jerome had gone back to prison four years after the photograph. Arrested again, a robbery this time, desperation and bad choices and the gravitational pull of the same streets that had produced the first offense. He did not know that Jerome had served eleven years. He did not know that Jerome had died in a prison riot in 2009, age thirty-two, killed not by violence but by a stampede in a corridor — trampled, the report said, though Thomas would never read the report, would never know there was a report. He did not know that Jerome had died in the same facility, on the same day, in the same riot that killed the ex-husband of a woman named Keisha Williams, a woman Thomas had never met and never would.

He knew none of this. He sat in the council chamber with his jaundiced hands and his missing ring and his eighty-seven thousand dollars of someone else's money, and he thought about a boy who had looked surprised by mercy, and he felt something — not guilt, exactly, not regret, something lower and older than both of those, a subsidence, as if the ground beneath the chair were slowly giving way.

The council president called the vote.

"Resolution 2019-47. The Chair will now call the roll. Council Member Adams?"

"Aye."

"Council Member Alvarez?"

"No."

The names proceeded in alphabetical order. Thomas was near the end. He had time. He sat and listened to the voices — aye, no, aye, aye, no, aye — each one falling into place like a stone dropped into a well, the sound traveling down into something deep and dark and final. The math was known. Whitfield had nine votes purchased and five he could count on through ideology and three he expected from inertia, the tendency of elected officials to vote yes on anything with the word "development" in the title. The opposition had eight firm nos. Thomas's vote was the seventeenth of twenty-one. By the time they reached him, the count would be ten to six, and his aye would make it eleven, and the resolution would pass with a comfortable margin.

"Council Member Reeves?"

"Aye."

"Council Member Reed?"

Thomas looked at the gallery. The developer, Gerald Whitfield, had leaned forward slightly in his seat, the posture of a man waiting for a formality. The families were still. The woman in the headscarf had closed her eyes. The child was still asleep against its mother's shoulder.

The photograph of Jerome in his pocket — he'd put it there, folded once, before leaving his office. He could feel it against his chest, the sharp edge of the folded paper pressing through the fabric of his shirt.

Sophie's voice. *I want you there.*

The council president repeated: "Council Member Reed?"

The room was very quiet.

Thomas opened his mouth. He looked at Whitfield. He looked at the woman with the headscarf. He looked at his own hands, jaundiced and trembling under the green desk lamp, the bare finger where the ring had been.

He did not vote yes.

He did not vote no. He did not have that in him — not the courage, not the clarity, not whatever it was that Councilwoman Alvarez had that allowed her to say no, plainly and without apology, to say *this is wrong* and mean it. He was not that person. He had not been that person for a very long time, and he could not become that person in a single evening, in a single vote, in the ninety minutes between his daughter's phone call and the calling of his name. He was not capable of that transformation. He knew this about himself with a precision that felt surgical — the understanding, cut clean and bloodless, that he was too far gone for heroism.

But he could stop. He could, in this one moment, simply stop.

"I abstain," Thomas said.

The room moved. Not physically — no one stood, no one shouted, but the air in the chamber shifted, a change in pressure, the way a room changes when something unexpected enters it. Gerald Whitfield's head turned. The council president paused, her pen hovering above the tally sheet. Councilwoman Alvarez looked at Thomas for the second time that night, and this time she did not look away.

"Let the record reflect that Council Member Reed abstains," the council president said.

The vote continued. Thomas did not hear it. He was looking at his hands.

The final tally was ten in favor, eight opposed, one abstention, two absent. The resolution required eleven votes to pass. It failed by one.

---

The corridor afterward was chaos. Whitfield's attorneys were on their phones. The families were embracing — the woman in the headscarf held the girl with the posterboard sign, and the girl was crying, and the woman was saying something Thomas couldn't hear, something low and steady in a language he didn't speak. The council members moved in their separate orbits, some toward the elevator, some toward the press, some toward the dark offices where the real conversations happened.

Whitfield found Thomas in the hallway. He did not touch Thomas. He stood three feet away and spoke in a voice that was perfectly level and perfectly clear and contained within it the entire architecture of threat without a single threatening word.

"That was a mistake," Whitfield said.

Thomas said nothing.

"A significant mistake."

"I understand."

"Do you?"

Thomas looked at him. Gerald Whitfield, sixty-one, gray at the temples, a face that had been shaped by decades of getting what he paid for. Behind him, through the glass doors of the council chamber, Thomas could see the families beginning to leave, filing out through the metal detectors in the lobby, the sleeping child now awake and blinking in the fluorescent light.

"I understand," Thomas said again.

Whitfield left. His attorneys followed. Their footsteps echoed in the corridor and then were gone, and Thomas stood alone under the fluorescent lights of City Hall at twenty minutes past midnight, and the building was empty, and the silence was the particular silence of a place that had been full of voices and was now full of their absence.

He walked to his office. He sat at his desk. The three photographs were still arranged where he'd left them: the young man, the bride, the girl.

He could feel it — the thing that was coming. Not the FBI specifically, not the indictment, not the specific machinery of consequence, but the weight of it, the gathering mass. The way you can feel a storm before it arrives, the pressure dropping, the air going thick and metallic. He had been in this building for twelve years. He had taken money for eight of those years. He had voted the way he was told to vote, had drafted the language he was told to draft, had turned away the community organizer who came to his office three times because the organizer's presence was an inconvenience and because Thomas had learned, over eight years, to convert inconvenience into absence, to make the things that troubled him go away by simply not seeing them.

The abstention would not save him. He knew this. One vote, one night, one failure to raise his hand did not cancel eight years of raised hands, of ayes spoken into microphones in rooms just like this one, of resolutions passed and families displaced and developers enriched and the slow, methodical conversion of a public trust into a private account. The math did not work that way. Moral math did not have a reset button.

But two thousand families would not be displaced tomorrow. That was something. Not enough — nothing he could do from this desk, in this building, in the remaining years of whatever this life was becoming, would be enough — but something. A single night when the machinery had paused. When the thing that was going to happen did not happen, because a man who had been paid to make it happen chose, in the smallest possible way, to not.

He picked up the phone. Sophie's number was on the recent calls list. He looked at it. Ten digits, a New Jersey area code, the line that connected to a woman he had made and failed, the woman who had said *I want you there* and then hung up before he could say anything back.

He should call. He should call and say he was sorry, not for the vote, not for tonight, but for all of it — for the Flatbush rezoning and the eight years and the ring in the box on the nightstand and the three years of silence and the community center in the Bronx where he had been someone worth photographing. He should call and say that Sophie's voice on the phone had done something to him, had moved something that he thought had calcified, and that he didn't know what it meant yet but he wanted to find out.

He should call.

He set the phone down.

The office was dark except for the desk lamp, and Centre Street was empty through the window, and the municipal parking garage across the way was a concrete grid of fluorescent light with no cars in it, and Thomas Reed sat in his chair with three photographs on his desk and a folded picture of a boy named Jerome against his chest and did not call his daughter.

He sat there for a long time. The sandwich had gone completely stale. The coffee in the mug on the shelf behind him had gone cold hours ago, a dark meniscus with a film of oil on its surface. The building's heating system ticked and groaned. Somewhere in the corridor, a janitor's cart rolled across linoleum, the wheels squeaking in a rhythm that sounded, if you were alone and exhausted and had just done the smallest right thing in a career of wrong ones, almost like a question.

He did not have the answer. He sat in the dark and did not have it.

<!-- AGENT:NOTE — Thomas's POV is claustrophobic by design: locked tight to his perception, his guilt, his rationalizations. The narration colors itself with his self-awareness — he knows what he is, which is part of the tragedy. Azrael's intervention (timing the visit to prompt Sophie's call) is entirely invisible from Thomas's perspective; there's no supernatural element in this chapter. Jerome's death is delivered in a passage of dramatic irony — the narrator reveals what Thomas doesn't know, using the same structural technique as Chapter 2's ending (listing what Sarah "did not know"). The connection to Keisha's ex-husband dying in the same riot is planted for readers tracking the web. -->
