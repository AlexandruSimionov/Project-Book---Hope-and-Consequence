# Chapter 2: Try Once More

**Queens, New York — January 1985**

---

The coffee had gone cold an hour ago, but Sarah Morrison drank it anyway, standing at the nurses' station with one hip against the counter and her eyes on the cardiac monitor at the far end of the hall. Tepid, over-extracted, faintly burnt. She'd stopped tasting it around hour eighteen. Now, at hour twenty-two, it was just a vehicle for caffeine, a ritual her hands performed while her brain tried to keep the lights on.

Three AM at St. Michael's. The fluorescent tubes overhead buzzed at a frequency that lived right behind her eyes, turning every surface the same jaundiced yellow — the linoleum, the walls, the skin of her own hands where they gripped the Styrofoam cup. Under those lights, everyone looked ill. The patients. The nurses. The young doctor with the dark circles spreading like bruises beneath her eyes, the one who kept checking the clock and then looking away from it, as if the time might be different if she came at it from a different angle.

Twenty-eight years old. Third-year resident. Dr. Sarah Morrison, who had wanted to be a doctor since she was nine and watched her father die of a heart attack on the kitchen floor while her mother screamed into the phone at a 911 dispatcher. She had been useless then, a child kneeling on cold tile, pressing her small hands against her father's chest because she'd seen it on television and didn't know what else to do. She had promised herself, on that floor, that she would never be useless again.

She did not feel like she was keeping that promise.

Two patients lost this week. Mr. Aguilar on Tuesday — aortic dissection, sixty-three, nothing anyone could have done, the attending said afterward, a hand on her shoulder she hadn't asked for. Mrs. Patterson on Thursday — pulmonary embolism, post-surgical, a clot that had been sitting in her leg like a bomb for days and chose the worst possible moment to travel. Also nothing anyone could have done, the attending said. Also the hand on the shoulder. As if the touching were a kind of medicine too, a laying on of hands that could absolve her of the look on Mrs. Patterson's daughter's face in the hallway — that expression of someone learning in real time that the world was not what she had believed it to be.

Sarah had gone home after Mrs. Patterson and sat in her apartment for forty-five minutes without turning on the lights. She'd sat on the edge of her bed in the dark and thought about veterinary school. She'd thought about law school. She'd thought about the girl she'd been at nine years old, kneeling on the kitchen floor, and she'd thought: *You would have lost him anyway. Even with training. Even with everything you know now. You would have knelt there and done everything right and he still would have died.*

She did not find this thought comforting.

Now it was Saturday. Another shift. The overnight, because third-year residents lived on the overnight the way certain deep-sea fish lived in the dark — not happily, but completely, their bodies adapted to the pressure and the absence of light. Her feet ached in the way that meant the arches were giving out, not the pleasant tiredness of a long walk but a structural complaint, the bones and tendons sending up formal grievances. Her lower back had entered a negotiation with the rest of her body, and the terms were not favorable.

The monitor at the end of the hall beeped. It had been beeping all night. Mrs. Chen — Rosa Chen, seventy-one, admitted six hours ago with acute myocardial infarction, anterior wall, the kind of heart attack that killed people more often than it didn't. They'd stabilized her. Then she'd destabilized. Then they'd stabilized her again. The heart was a muscle, Sarah reminded herself, and like all muscles it could be pushed past its limit, and when that happened no amount of electricity or chemistry could undo the fact that the tissue had simply quit.

The monitor beeped faster.

Sarah set down the coffee and moved.

---

Room 4. The light was the same sick yellow as everywhere else, but brighter here, aimed at the bed where Rosa Chen lay with her hospital gown pulled to one side and electrode pads stuck to her chest like pale, square barnacles. She was small. That was the thing Sarah always noticed first, the way certain patients seemed to shrink inside the bed, dwarfed by the machinery and the tubing and the sheer institutional weight of the room. Rosa Chen weighed perhaps a hundred and five pounds. She had white hair that someone — a daughter, a friend — had braided neatly before bringing her in, and the braid lay over one shoulder, undone at the tip where the elastic had slipped off during the initial resuscitation.

The cardiac monitor showed ventricular fibrillation. The heart was shaking instead of pumping, a bag of disorganized electricity. Sarah had seen it a hundred times. She had seen it twice this week already.

"V-fib," said Denise, the charge nurse, who had been at St. Michael's for twenty years and had the flat, measured voice of someone who had stopped being surprised by the ways a body could fail. She was already pulling the crash cart closer. "Eighteen minutes."

Eighteen minutes. Sarah looked at the clock on the wall. Eighteen minutes since the code had been called, since Rosa Chen's heart had decided to stop doing the only job it had. Eighteen minutes of CPR and epi and atropine and defibrillation, eighteen minutes during which Sarah's team had been cycling through compressions and shocks with the grim efficiency of people who did this several times a week, and the heart had not responded. Not once. Not a flicker.

The attending, Dr. Kessler, had gone home at midnight. He'd left Sarah in charge because she was competent and because he was tired and because the unspoken understanding was that third-year residents needed to learn to make the calls that no one wanted to make.

Sarah pulled on gloves. Her hands trembled, and she made fists inside the latex to stop it, held them for three seconds, released. A trick she'd taught herself during her first year, when the shaking had been so bad she'd been afraid someone would notice.

"Charge to three hundred," she said.

The defibrillator whined as it charged. The sound was high and dental, a noise that always made Sarah think of the waiting room at the orthodontist's office, the fluorescent lights and old magazines and the tinny whine of equipment behind the door. Absurd association. The brain at three AM was a museum of unhelpful connections.

"Charged."

"Clear."

She placed the paddles. The body jumped. The monitor showed the wild scrawl of artifact, then settled back into the trembling, purposeless rhythm of fibrillation.

Nothing.

"Resume compressions."

Linda, the second nurse, stepped in and began. She was young, maybe twenty-four, and she compressed with the kind of desperate vigor that Sarah recognized from her own first year, the force that came from believing that if you just pushed hard enough, meant it enough, the muscle would listen. It was not a bad impulse. It was also not sufficient.

"Epi, one milligram, IV push," Sarah said.

The drug went in. They waited. The compressions continued, Linda's palms stacked on Rosa Chen's sternum, the bed shaking with each thrust. The monitor did not change.

"Eighteen minutes is a long time," Denise said.

It was not a statement of fact. It was a statement of opinion, delivered in the tone of fact. Sarah had learned to hear the difference. Eighteen minutes was not, technically, the cutoff for anything. The protocols said nothing about eighteen minutes. But protocols were written in offices by people who had the luxury of theoretical certainty, and in the room, at three in the morning, with a seventy-one-year-old woman whose heart had been fibrillating for eighteen minutes and whose chances of meaningful neurological recovery decreased with every additional minute, eighteen was a long time.

The nurses exchanged a look. Sarah saw it. She had been seeing looks like that all week — the subtle, lateral communication of people who had been doing this longer than she had, who had developed a shared vocabulary of glances that meant *it's time* and *she's gone* and *the young doctor doesn't know when to stop.*

She didn't blame them. They were probably right.

Sarah looked at Rosa Chen. At the braid coming undone. At the hands, which were small and brown and had a thick ridge of callus along the index finger of the right hand — a sewing callus, Sarah thought, or maybe a cooking callus, the kind you got from decades of holding a knife a certain way. Someone's hands. Someone's particular, specific hands, with their own history and their own calluses and their own way of holding things.

"Time," Sarah said. She heard her own voice, flat and professional, the voice of a woman who had learned to announce failure as if it were simply the next item on the agenda. "Time of death — "

She stopped.

Something. Not a sound. Not exactly a thought. Something between the two, or behind them, or beneath — a sensation she would spend the rest of her life trying to describe and never quite managing. As if the room had inhaled. As if the air itself had leaned in close and murmured directly into the part of her brain that made decisions, bypassing her ears entirely.

*Try once more.*

Sarah stood very still. The monitor beeped its useless rhythm. Linda's hands were still on the chest, paused, waiting for the call. Denise had one hand on the chart, ready to write the time. The room was full of the sound of machines and the absence of a heartbeat and the buzz of the fluorescent lights, and in that noise there was — or there wasn't — or she couldn't tell —

She couldn't tell.

Her father on the kitchen floor. Her small hands on his chest. The 911 dispatcher asking her mother questions. The linoleum, which was green and had a crack running through it in the shape of a river, and she had stared at that crack while she pressed and pressed and pressed.

"One more round," Sarah said.

Denise looked up from the chart. "Doctor?"

"One more round. Charge to three-sixty. Push another epi."

The look again. The lateral glance between the nurses. But Denise set down the pen and Linda resumed compressions and the defibrillator began its dental whine again, climbing to three hundred and sixty joules.

"Epi's in."

"Charged."

"Clear."

Sarah placed the paddles on Rosa Chen's chest and pressed the buttons and the body jumped and the monitor showed artifact and Sarah watched the screen with the absolute, total attention of a woman who had nothing left — no faith, no optimism, no theory about what a life was worth or what medicine could do — nothing except the stubbornness of someone who had decided, for no reason she could articulate, to do the thing one more time.

The artifact cleared.

The line on the monitor organized. Not fibrillation. Not the flat, dead line of asystole. A rhythm. Uneven, tentative, feeling its way forward like a person walking in the dark, but a rhythm. A heartbeat.

QRS complex. Then another. Then another.

"Sinus," Denise said, and her voice had changed. The flatness was gone. "Sinus rhythm. Rate of — fifty-two. Fifty-four."

The room went quiet. Not silent — the monitor beeped, the ventilator hissed, the fluorescents buzzed their eternal buzz — but quiet in the way a room goes quiet when the people in it have stopped breathing for a moment, when the thing they expected to happen did not happen and the thing that happened instead has not yet been absorbed.

Linda took her hands off Rosa Chen's chest and stepped back. Her palms were shaking. She looked at Sarah and her mouth was open and she did not say anything.

"Blood pressure," Sarah said, because she could not think of what else to say, because her training was the only thing still working and it said *check the blood pressure, check the oxygen, stabilize, stabilize, stabilize.*

"Eighty over fifty. Coming up."

"Oxygen?"

"Ninety-one. Ninety-two."

Sarah watched the numbers climb. She watched Rosa Chen's chest rise and fall on its own, the shallow, fragile movement of lungs that had decided, for no reason the science could fully explain, to keep going. The braid on her shoulder moved slightly with each breath. The callused hands lay still at her sides, and they were warm — Sarah touched them, because she needed to know, and they were warm.

"Okay," Sarah said. Her voice was not steady. "Okay. Let's get a twelve-lead. ABG. Chest X-ray. And — I want someone watching her. Continuous monitoring. I want — "

She stopped, because her throat had closed and she was afraid that if she kept talking, the words would come out wrong — not clinical, not competent, but raw, the way words sound when they come from the part of you that is still nine years old and kneeling on a kitchen floor.

"I'll stay with her," Linda said.

Sarah nodded. She pulled off her gloves. Her hands were trembling again, and she did not make fists to stop it. She let them shake. It felt earned.

---

She stepped out of the room and stood in the hallway for a long time. The hallway was empty. The fluorescent lights buzzed. The linoleum was scuffed and gray and reflected the yellow light in long, warped streaks, and Sarah stared at it and breathed.

She did not know what had happened in there. She was a scientist — she believed in evidence, in mechanism, in the explicable chain of cause and effect that turned electricity into contraction and contraction into circulation and circulation into life. She believed that Rosa Chen's heart had restarted because the combination of epinephrine and electrical shock had, on the nineteenth attempt, achieved the precise conditions necessary to restore organized cardiac activity. She believed this because it was true, because it was the explanation that fit the evidence.

She also believed that something had spoken to her. Not aloud. Not in words, exactly. But something had intervened in the half-second between the decision to stop and the decision to continue, and that something had not come from her. She did not know what to do with this belief. It sat alongside the other one, the scientific one, like two photographs of the same room taken from different angles — both accurate, both incomplete, and she could not reconcile them.

She would never reconcile them. She would carry both for sixty years and never once resolve the contradiction, and she would eventually come to understand that the contradiction was the point — that faith and evidence were not opponents but collaborators, each one covering the other's blind spots, and that the space between them was where the practice of medicine actually lived.

But that was later. That was decades of patients and losses and saves and the slow accumulation of a philosophy she would pass on to every resident she ever trained. For now, she was twenty-eight and shaking in a hallway and the woman in the room behind her was alive for reasons Sarah could not fully explain.

She pushed off the wall and walked toward the waiting room. She needed to sit down. She needed another cup of that terrible coffee. She needed five minutes where no one was dying.

---

The waiting room at St. Michael's was a small rectangle of orange plastic chairs and month-old magazines, lit by the same fluorescent tubes as everywhere else but dimmer, three of the bulbs gone and no one bothering to replace them. A television mounted in the corner played the local news with the sound off, the anchor's mouth moving in silent shapes that looked like warnings. The air smelled of floor wax and the hand sanitizer dispenser mounted by the door, a chemical sweetness that never quite covered the deeper institutional smell beneath — old heating vents, decades of floor cleaner, the faint, persistent odor of people in distress.

At three-thirty in the morning, the waiting room should have been empty. It mostly was. But there was a woman sitting in the far corner, in the chair beneath the dead television, and Sarah noticed her because of how still she was.

Not sleeping — her eyes were open. Not reading, not watching the silent news. Just sitting, with her hands in her lap and her coat still on, a dark wool coat that looked warm and well-made, and she was looking at nothing in particular with an expression that Sarah, in her exhausted state, could not read. It was not grief, exactly. It was not worry. It was something quieter and more worn than either of those things, something that reminded Sarah of the way her mother had looked in the years after her father's death — not sad so much as attentive, as if she were listening for something she'd been waiting a long time to hear.

Sarah thought about asking her if she needed help. The woman didn't appear to be waiting for anyone. There was no registration slip in her hand, no dog-eared paperback, none of the usual artifacts of the hospital vigil. She was just there, the way certain people are simply there in certain places, existing in a space without seeming to need a reason for it.

But Sarah's feet hurt and her hands were still shaking and the coffee she needed was in the break room, not the waiting room, and the woman in the corner did not look like she needed anything from a twenty-eight-year-old resident who had just spent twenty minutes trying to restart a stranger's heart.

Sarah turned and walked toward the break room.

Behind her, the woman in the dark coat sat very still, watching the hallway where Sarah had been, her expression unchanged. After a moment, she closed her eyes and leaned her head back against the wall, and if anyone had been watching — which no one was, because it was three-thirty in the morning and the waiting room at St. Michael's was the kind of place where no one watched anything — they might have thought she was praying, or resting, or simply enduring the particular weight of a long night in a place where the distance between living and dying was measured in minutes and milligrams and the willingness of one exhausted woman to try once more.

---

In the break room, Sarah poured coffee from the pot that had been sitting on the burner since eleven. It was beyond burnt now, reduced to something dense and acrid, closer to tar than a beverage. She drank it standing at the counter, both hands around the cup, and she stared at the bulletin board on the opposite wall. Staff notices. A flyer for a blood drive. A cartoon someone had clipped from a newspaper and pinned up — a doctor saying to a patient, *The good news is you're going to have a disease named after you* — the paper yellowed and curling at the corners, pinned there so long it had become part of the wall.

Her pager was quiet. The hallway was quiet. Rosa Chen was alive.

Sarah drank the terrible coffee, and she thought about what she would say to the residents she would someday train, if she stayed in this profession, if she didn't quit and go to veterinary school or law school or any of the other schools she had contemplated in her dark apartment two nights ago. She thought about what she would tell them when they stood in a hallway like this one, shaking, with a patient alive in the room behind them and no explanation for it that covered all the evidence.

She would tell them about Rosa Chen. She would tell them about the eighteen minutes and the look the nurses gave each other and the moment when she almost said the words *time of death* and didn't. She would tell them about the thing she heard that she couldn't explain, and she would not try to explain it, because the explanation wasn't the point.

The point was the trying. The point was that you did not know — could never know — what a life might do once you gave it back. Rosa Chen was seventy-one years old, and she was alive, and she would go home and eat meals and speak to her daughter and hold the hands of people who loved her and do all the ordinary things that constituted a life, and every single one of those things existed because Sarah had decided, at three in the morning, for no good reason, to place the paddles one more time.

*Always try once more. You never know what a life might do.*

She did not know yet that this sentence would become a kind of scripture, passed from her lips to the ears of hundreds of residents over the course of sixty years, carried by them into their own practice, their own three AM hallways, their own moments of exhaustion and doubt. She did not know that the old woman in room 4 had a daughter who would have a son named Marcus, who would grow up hearing his mother say *your grandmother told me the angels would help*, who would carry that sentence like a stone in his pocket through a life shaped by its weight. She did not know that the woman in the waiting room was not a woman. She did not know that the whisper she could not explain was, in fact, a whisper.

She knew none of this. She was twenty-eight years old, and her feet hurt, and the coffee was terrible, and someone was alive who should not have been, and that was enough.

She finished the coffee. She set the cup in the sink. She went back to work.

<!-- AGENT:NOTE — This chapter establishes Sarah Morrison's core philosophy ("try once more") and her foundational experience. The "whisper" is kept ambiguous per the reader's POV — Sarah's scientific mind registers it as intuition or exhaustion, not as supernatural. Cassiel is present in the waiting room but unidentified; the connection is invisible from Sarah's limited perspective. Rosa Chen's identity as Marcus's grandmother is withheld from Sarah's knowledge — she's simply a patient. The final paragraphs shift to medium narrative distance to plant the thematic seeds of consequence without violating Sarah's limited POV (framed as what she "did not know"). -->
