# Chapter 7: Connections

## Baltimore, 1994

The coffee was the color of river silt and tasted approximately the same. Thomas Reed drank it anyway, standing in the hallway outside Courtroom 4B with his briefcase wedged between his ankles and his tie loosened to the second button. He'd been up since four-thirty, mouthing his closing argument to the window of his studio apartment while the radiator clanked beneath it. Now it was eight-forty, and the fluorescent light above him flickered every nine seconds, just enough to notice, not enough to justify a maintenance call.

He was twenty-four years old. He had been a public defender for eleven months.

Thomas opened his briefcase and pulled out the manila folder for the third time that morning. Jerome Carter. Case number 94-CR-2847. He didn't need to read it again. He'd memorized it weeks ago, the way he used to memorize Bible verses as a kid in his mother's kitchen: through sheer repetition until the words became reflex.

Jerome was seventeen. He'd been the lookout during a corner-store robbery on North Avenue last October, standing outside with his hands in his jacket pockets while two older guys went inside with a pistol and took six hundred dollars from the register. The gun wasn't Jerome's. The plan wasn't Jerome's. Jerome had been there because Daryl Simms was his cousin's boyfriend and because saying no to Daryl Simms was not something people in that neighborhood did casually. The store owner, Mr. Park, had not been hurt.

The prosecution wanted to try Jerome as an adult. Thomas wanted to keep him in juvenile court, push for probation and community service. The kid had no priors. His guidance counselor at Douglass High had written a letter calling him "quiet, cooperative, and unlikely to be a discipline problem." It was the kind of letter that said almost nothing, which meant the kid had been invisible at school. Not troubled enough to flag, not exceptional enough to notice.

Thomas thought about that word. *Invisible.* He'd been invisible once. Middle school, before his mother had sat him down and said, *Thomas, the world is not going to hand you anything. You speak up or you disappear.* He'd chosen to speak up. Jerome hadn't had the same instruction manual.

A clerk leaned out from down the hall. "Courtroom 4B, docket's moving. Reed? You're third."

Thomas straightened his tie. The tie was maroon, a graduation gift from his aunt Dorothy, who believed that a Black man in a courtroom needed to look like he'd been there before, even if he hadn't.

He had three minutes for closing. Judge Halliday was generous with some things but not with time. Thomas stood, buttoned his jacket, and looked at Jerome, who was seated at the defense table in a white shirt his mother had ironed that morning, the creases sharp enough to see from across the room. Jerome's hands were flat on the table. He was staring at them.

"Your Honor," Thomas said, and his voice came out steady, which was not always the case. "The prosecution has asked this court to treat Jerome Carter as an adult. To sentence him as though he held the gun, planned the robbery, and chose violence. But the facts tell a different story."

He paused. Not for drama. Because Judge Halliday was writing something, and you didn't talk while Halliday wrote.

"Jerome Carter was a lookout. He stood on a sidewalk. He did not enter the store. He did not handle the weapon. He was seventeen years old, in the company of a twenty-six-year-old man with a history of violent offenses. The question before this court isn't whether Jerome Carter made a mistake. He did. He knows that. But the question is whether a seventeen-year-old boy who stood on a sidewalk should have his life defined by the worst decision of his adolescence."

ADA Blount, the assistant district attorney, watched from the prosecution's table with the weary efficiency of someone filling out tax returns. She wasn't cruel. She was processing volume. Thomas understood that Jerome Carter was a file number to her, not a face. That was the machinery. That was what he was pushing against.

"We are asking this court not for leniency but for proportionality. For a chance at rehabilitation, which is what juvenile justice is supposed to provide."

He sat down. His hands were damp. He pressed them flat against his thighs under the table, where no one could see.

Halliday took off his glasses and cleaned them with a cloth from his breast pocket, a ritual Thomas had seen enough times to know it meant the judge was thinking. Jerome's mother, Denise, sat in the front row with her purse in her lap and her mouth set in a line that Thomas recognized as the face of a woman holding herself together by force.

"Mr. Reed," Halliday said, putting his glasses back on, "I'm inclined to agree with your assessment. The juvenile system exists for cases precisely like this one."

The terms came: reduced charge, juvenile adjudication, eighteen months of probation, two hundred hours of community service, a mentorship program through Morrell. If Jerome completed the terms, the record would be sealed.

Thomas wrote it all down, though his pen was shaking and his notes would later prove difficult to read. Beside him, Jerome let out a breath that sounded like it had been held for months.

Outside, the October air was sharp enough to feel like a correction after the staleness of the building. Thomas stood on the steps and watched Jerome and his mother walk toward the parking lot. Denise had her arm around her son's shoulders, talking rapidly, the words inaudible at this distance but the cadence unmistakable: gratitude and warning braided together, *thank God* and *don't you ever* woven into a single stream.

Jerome looked back once. He didn't wave. Thomas gave him a small nod, and the kid turned and got into his mother's car. A Buick, late eighties, rust on the quarter panels. It turned east toward North Avenue.

Thomas sat on the courthouse steps and let himself feel it. Most of his cases ended in plea bargains that felt like organized surrenders. But today, the system had bent toward something that looked like justice, and Thomas had been the one who bent it.

He closed his eyes and tipped his head back. October in Baltimore: cool air, warm light, the sky scrubbed blue. He thought about calling his mother but decided to wait until evening, when he could tell the story with all the beats in the right order. She'd want details. She always wanted details.

The Morrell Community Center sat on the corner of Eutaw and Mosher, a converted rowhouse with a hand-painted sign and a basketball court out back that was two inches short on both sides. Tonight it smelled like floor cleaner and sheet cake, and someone had taped balloons to folding tables with masking tape. A hand-drawn banner read: MORRELL FALL CELEBRATION.

Thomas hadn't planned to come. But the center's director, Dwight Morris, had called and said *you should be here, counselor,* and the invitation felt like a summons. He got a paper plate of food and stood near the wall, eating and watching the room the way he watched courtrooms: looking for the structure underneath the noise.

That was when he saw her.

She was standing by the punch bowl, talking to Dwight's wife, and she was laughing at something — not a polite laugh but a real one, her head tipping back, the sound carrying across the room like a note that didn't need amplification. She had braids pulled back from her face and the kind of posture that suggested she was listening carefully, leaning slightly forward, making the other person feel important.

Thomas forgot about his cornbread.

He finished his food, talked to Dwight about Jerome's community service schedule, shook hands with parents who thanked him for a housing issue he'd helped with months ago — gratitude migrating through the neighborhood network, which was how things worked in places like this.

Then she was next to him.

"You're the lawyer," she said. It wasn't a question.

"Public defender. Thomas Reed."

"I know." Her grip was firm and brief. "Michelle Warren. Social services, Pennsylvania Ave. Dwight said you're the one who kept the Carter kid out of adult court."

"That's the goal."

"It's a good goal. Most of the lawyers I work with have stopped caring about goals. They care about billable hours."

"Public defenders don't have billable hours. We have caseloads."

"And how's your caseload?"

"Terrible," he said, and she laughed again, and the sound narrowed the room until it was just the two of them standing by a folding table under balloons that were already losing air.

They talked for an hour. She told him about her job — intake caseworker, mostly families, the bureaucratic trench warfare of getting people into shelters and programs. He told her about the scholarship that got him through law school and the loans that would keep him paying for a decade, about his mother at the post office who believed education was the only door nobody could lock behind you.

"You really believe in this," she said at one point. "In the system. That it can work."

"I believe it can work when people care enough to make it work. Today I saw it."

"And tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow I've got three arraignments, and none of them will go this well." He shrugged. "But that's tomorrow."

She looked at him, her expression unreadable in the way that social workers' faces could be — professional assessment and genuine interest occupying the same features.

"You're an optimist," she said.

"That a bad thing?"

"Not yet."

He asked for her number before he left. She wrote it on a napkin, each digit distinct. He folded it and put it in his breast pocket, next to the pen he'd used in court that morning, and when he walked to his car the napkin sat against his chest like a second heartbeat.

Back at the office on St. Paul Street — five desks, a copier that broke every other week — Thomas found Robert Halloway waiting in his chair.

Halloway was the senior partner, if a public defender's office could be said to have partners. Fifty-eight, gray-haired, with the kind of weary competence that came from thirty years of fighting cases he usually lost. He still came in on Saturdays to review his juniors' briefs in red pen. Thomas admired him. Most of the young defenders did.

"Heard about the Carter ruling," Halloway said, grimacing at his Styrofoam cup. "Halliday gave you the full juvenile package?"

"Probation, community service, mentorship. Record sealed on completion."

"Good work. You didn't overplay it. Let the facts be the argument." Halloway set the cup down. "Listen, Tom. You're good at this. You've got the instincts. You're going to win cases."

Thomas waited. There was a quality to Halloway's tone that suggested a conjunction was coming.

"But cases aren't the only thing that matter." Halloway leaned back. "You know the difference between a good public defender and one who actually changes things? Connections." He held up a hand. "I don't mean schmoozing. I mean relationships. The judges who take your calls. The DAs who'll negotiate in good faith. The politicians who fund the programs your clients need after sentencing. That's the scaffolding, Thomas. Without it, you're winning cases in a vacuum."

Thomas nodded. It sounded like wisdom.

"Good work on the Jerome case." Halloway stood and clapped Thomas on the shoulder. "But connections matter more than cases. Remember that."

He left. The office was quiet. Thomas turned the phrase over. *Connections matter more than cases.* He wrote it in the margin of his legal pad, next to the doodle of a half-drawn star.

It made sense. Of course it made sense. You couldn't save anyone from inside a vacuum.

He didn't hear the other thing in it. The door it would open, years later, to the room where relationships became transactions, where the scaffolding was rebuilt with favors and money and the slow, imperceptible trade of principle for access. He didn't hear it because he was twenty-four and the phrase sounded like mentorship. And maybe that was all Halloway meant. But the words would survive the intention. They'd follow Thomas through the years, accruing new meaning each time the definition of *connection* shifted — from colleague to contact to donor to co-conspirator — until the word no longer meant what Halloway had said in this office on this Tuesday in October.

But that was later. Right now, the phrase was clean.

Thomas got home at nine-fifteen. Third floor, Charles Street, a building that had been beautiful in the forties and was now held together by paint and the landlord's reluctance. He set his briefcase by the table, hung his jacket on the chair, and stood in front of the bathroom mirror.

The face looking back at him was young. He knew that the way a fish knows water — which is to say, not at all. He saw dark eyes, a clean jaw, the maroon tie loosened, the white shirt wrinkled from a long day.

He tried to see what Michelle Warren had seen. An optimist, she'd said. *Not yet* a bad thing. He smiled at himself, testing it, and found the smile came easily. A good man. That's what the mirror showed him. A man who had gotten up at four-thirty and fought for a seventeen-year-old kid and won. A man who had met a woman whose laugh restructured rooms. A man whose boss had told him that the future required only relationships and the ordinary cultivation of a life in service.

He liked what he saw.

He turned off the light, heated up leftover lo mein, ate it standing at the counter. Set the alarm for five. The napkin with Michelle's number was still in his breast pocket. He'd call her tomorrow. He was learning that timing mattered, in court and out of it.

He turned off the lights and stood for a moment at the window. Baltimore at night: the amber wash of streetlights, a siren winding through the west side. Somewhere out there, Jerome Carter was home, beginning the long work of earning back a future that Thomas had helped keep open.

He went to bed. He slept well.

He did not dream about Jerome Carter at thirty, the third arrest, the robbery that was his own this time, the fifteen-year sentence Thomas would not be there to fight. He did not dream about the riot at Jessup in 2008, the locked corridor, the body count that included a name Thomas would not recognize because by then Jerome Carter was no longer a face to him but a line item in the early chapter of a career that had gone somewhere else entirely.

He did not dream about David Okonkwo, eighteen years old in a courtroom that looked like this one, standing before a different judge while a prosecutor named Thomas Reed — older now, his tie a different color, his arguments calibrated not to justice but to a voting record — asked for the maximum sentence. He did not dream about this because it hadn't happened yet, and because the man who would do it did not yet exist.

He slept, and the room was quiet, and the city moved on without him, as cities do.
