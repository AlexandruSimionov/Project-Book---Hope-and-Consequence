# Chapter 43: David's Funeral

**March 2042 — Baltimore, Maryland**

---

The heart attack came at six-fourteen on a Wednesday morning, in the kitchen of the row house David shared with his wife, while he was making coffee.

He had been making coffee the same way for twelve years — since he got out, since he learned that the world had changed while he was inside and that one of the ways it had changed was that coffee was now a thing people took seriously, a commodity with origins and roast profiles and brewing methods, and David had looked at all of it and chosen a percolator from the Goodwill and a can of Folgers from the grocery store, because he had spent eight years drinking whatever the commissary sold and his standards had been permanently calibrated to a baseline where hot and brown were sufficient criteria.

He was standing at the counter. The percolator was doing its thing — the low, rhythmic sound of water cycling through the basket, a sound that David liked because it was mechanical and predictable and because it happened every morning and the happening of it was a kind of promise that the morning was real. His wife, Miriam, was upstairs. He could hear her moving — the creak of the bedroom floor, the running water, the muffled sound of the radio she listened to while she dressed, a gospel station that David tolerated because Miriam had tolerated every other thing about him and the radio was a small debt in a large account.

The pain started in his left arm. Not dramatic — not the clutching, gasping, movie-heart-attack pain that he would have recognized and responded to. A numbness. A heaviness, as if the arm had been slept on and was now waking up with a complaint it couldn't quite articulate. He shook it. He picked up the coffee mug with his right hand. He thought about the shop — the trade school, Second Chance Auto & Trade, which he had opened ten years ago in a rented garage on Pratt Street and which now occupied a converted warehouse with six bays and a classroom and a waiting list of students that was longer than the list of students he could serve, which was the best kind of problem to have, which was the kind of problem that David had spent twenty years not knowing he would ever be fortunate enough to face.

He thought about the boy coming in today. Terrence. Seventeen. Referred by the juvenile court, same as a dozen others, the terms of his probation including vocational training, which was how the system described what David did — vocational training, as if the thing happening in those bays was primarily about engines and transmissions and not about a grown man standing next to a teenager and showing him that his hands could build something instead of break it, that the satisfaction of a problem solved was available to him, that the world contained this option and it was not locked behind a door he couldn't reach.

The pain moved to his chest. It sat behind the sternum like a fist, and the fist closed, and David Okonkwo set down the coffee mug with the care of a man who understood, in the space between one heartbeat and the place where the next heartbeat should have been and was not, that something fundamental was happening.

"Miriam," he said.

His voice was calm. He noted this the way he noted everything — observationally, from the place behind his eyes where the watcher lived, the same watcher who had sat at the edge of a public pool at twelve and scanned the water and seen a boy going under. The watcher was always there. The watcher registered that his voice was calm and that his left arm was not working and that the fist behind his sternum was tightening and that the percolator was still making its sound, the mechanical cycling that was a promise, and the promise was being broken.

"Miriam."

She came to the top of the stairs. "What?"

"Call 911."

She was down the stairs before he finished the sentence. She was a nurse — had been a nurse for twenty-two years, ER and then surgical and then hospice and then back to ER because she missed the urgency, because some people were built for the edge and Miriam was one of them. She saw his face. She saw the arm. She had her phone in her hand and was dialing before she reached the kitchen, and she was talking — to the dispatcher, to David, to both — in the steady, efficient voice of a woman who had managed other people's emergencies for two decades and who was now managing her own with the same competence and a different kind of terror, the kind that lived below the competence and that she would deal with later.

David sat down on the kitchen floor. Not because he chose to — because his legs made the choice for him, the way legs do when the heart stops sending them sufficient blood. He sat with his back against the cabinet under the sink and his hands in his lap, and the floor was cold through his jeans, and the percolator was still going, and Miriam was on the phone, and outside the kitchen window the March sky was gray and low and held the particular stillness of a Baltimore morning before the city woke up.

He thought about the pool. He always thought about the pool. It was the first thing his mind went to when the context dropped away — when the machinery of daily life stopped and the quiet underneath was exposed, the pool was there, the water and the boy and the reaching in and the pulling out, the memory so old and so handled that it had achieved the smooth, worn quality of a stone carried in a pocket for decades, every edge rubbed away, the object reduced to its essential shape: *I saw someone drowning and I went in.*

The ambulance came. They put him on a stretcher. Miriam rode with him, holding his hand, and her hand was warm and her face was the face of a woman who was doing the thing she had been trained to do and who was also, beneath the doing, falling apart in a way that she would not allow herself to fall apart until later, until the crisis resolved or did not resolve, until the outcome was known.

In the ambulance, David looked at Miriam's face and said the thing that he had been meaning to say for the twelve years since she married a man who had spent eight years in prison and whose résumé was a single page and whose only references were a parole officer and an angel he could not name and who did not, to his knowledge, exist.

"You saved me," he said. "All of you. More than I saved anyone."

Miriam squeezed his hand. "Don't talk," she said. "Conserve."

"You all saved me more than I saved you."

"David."

"That's the thing I want—"

The monitor alarmed. Miriam's hand tightened on his. The paramedic moved. David closed his eyes, and the last thing he saw before the light changed was the gray Baltimore sky through the ambulance's rear window, and the sky was the same sky that covered everything, and it did not care, and its not-caring was not cruelty but simply the nature of sky, and David thought: *okay*, and then he thought nothing, because the heart that had been beating for fifty years — the heart that had pumped blood to the legs that ran across a pool deck to save a drowning boy, to the arms that held Miriam on their wedding day, to the hands that turned wrenches and taught teenagers to turn wrenches and that had, in the arithmetic of a life, moved more toward than away from — the heart stopped, and this time it did not restart.

---

The church was full by ten.

Grace Baptist on North Avenue, a brick building with a steeple that had been repainted three times in the last decade and that still held a slight lean to the east, a structural idiosyncrasy that the congregation had decided was charming rather than alarming. The sanctuary held two hundred and forty seats. By ten-fifteen, there were people standing along the walls, and by ten-thirty, there were people in the vestibule, and by ten-forty-five, there were people on the steps outside, in the March cold, in coats and dark clothes, and someone had propped the doors open so the sound system would carry.

Miriam sat in the front row. She wore black. Her face was composed in the way that a person's face is composed when the composing is the last act of will available to them, when everything else — the crying, the bargaining, the three days of lying in the bed that still smelled like him, the terrible administrative momentum of death, the phone calls and the arrangements and the casket that she chose because David would have hated the expensive one and laughed at the cheap one and the middle one was the closest she could get to what he would have wanted, which was probably a pine box and a hole, but Miriam was not giving him a pine box because she had married him and she would bury him and the burying would be done right — when everything else had been spent and the composure was what remained.

David's mother sat next to Miriam. She was seventy-two. She had visited him every month he was inside — every month, eight years, ninety-six visits, the bus to Dannemora and later the bus to the facility they transferred him to in 2016, the security check and the plastic chairs and the vending machines and the conversations that were never long enough and that carried, in their brevity, the entire weight of what could not be said in a room where guards stood at the doors and the clock on the wall counted down the minutes.

Behind the family, the church filled with the people David had touched. This is not metaphor. They were there — in the pews, along the walls, on the steps — and each of them carried a specific, concrete memory of David Okonkwo that was not an abstraction but an event, a moment, a thing that had happened between their life and his.

The young men from the shop. They sat together, a cluster of them, in the middle rows, wearing suits that did not quite fit because most of them owned one suit and the suit had been purchased for court appearances or job interviews and had not been worn since. They were quiet. They held their hands in their laps or on their knees, and their faces held the particular confusion of young men at a funeral — the recognition that death was real, that it happened to people you knew, that the man who had stood next to them in the bay and shown them how to pull a transmission was not coming back, and that the not-coming-back was permanent in a way that nothing else in their lives had been permanent, because most things in their lives could be taken away and given back — freedom, money, trust — but this could not.

DeShawn Williams sat in the third row. He was thirty-five. He had worked at the shop for six years, since his release, since David had taken him on because Keisha had asked and because David did not need to be asked — the asking was a formality, a bridge between two people who both understood that the boy needed the work and the work needed the boy. DeShawn had learned engines from David, but that was not what David had taught him. What David had taught him was that a man who had been inside could build something outside, that the narrative the world assigned to you — ex-con, felon, the labels that stuck to your name like grease stains on your work shirt — was not the only narrative available, that you could write another one, and the writing was slow and the writing was daily and the writing required showing up at the shop at seven every morning and standing next to a man who had done the same thing you had done and who had come out the other side of it and who was proof, living proof, that the other side existed.

DeShawn's hands were folded. His eyes were red. Next to him, his daughter — seven, her name was Autumn, she had David's gap-toothed grin though she was no relation, she had simply spent enough time at the shop to have absorbed his mannerisms the way children absorb the mannerisms of the adults who are kind to them — sat with a coloring book in her lap and the confused solemnity of a child who understood that something was wrong but not what.

Marcus Chen sat in the seventh row.

He was forty-six. He had gray at his temples — early, genetic, the same gene that had given his grandmother Rosa her white hair by sixty. He wore a dark suit that he had bought for a conference in Stockholm and had worn twice since. His wife, Amira, sat next to him, her hand on his knee, and their daughter, Sara, sat on his other side, and Sara — twenty-four, in her third year of residency, with her grandmother's hands and her father's stubbornness — sat very still, the way she sat during difficult cases, the way she had learned to sit in the presence of death so that death would not see her flinch.

Marcus had not spoken publicly about anything other than water filtration in his adult life. He was a scientist. He communicated in papers and data sets and the precise, impersonal language of methodology sections, and the prospect of standing in front of two hundred people and saying something about David Okonkwo that was adequate to what David Okonkwo had meant was a prospect that had kept him awake for three nights and that he had agreed to only because Miriam had asked and because Marcus understood that some debts could not be paid in private.

The service began. The pastor — a man named Reverend Coleman, who had known David for a decade and who had the deep, unhurried voice of a preacher who understood that the words mattered less than the space between them — spoke about David's life in the language of faith, which was the language that the church demanded and that David himself had never entirely adopted. David had attended Grace Baptist because Miriam attended Grace Baptist, and he had sat in the pew and listened to the sermons and bowed his head during the prayers with the respectful attention of a man who did not share the belief but who honored the believing, who understood that faith was, for the people around him, a technology for surviving the unsurvivable, and that his skepticism was his own business.

The choir sang. They sang "Precious Lord, Take My Hand," and the sound filled the sanctuary and spilled out through the propped doors onto the steps where the overflow crowd stood, and the sound was the sound of a community doing the only thing it could do in the presence of a loss it could not fix, which was to make the loss beautiful, to wrap it in harmony and rhythm and the ancient technology of voices joined, and the beauty did not reduce the loss but it made the loss bearable, which was the same thing as making it survivable.

Three speakers. Reverend Coleman. A former student named James, who was twenty-six and who now owned his own shop in East Baltimore and who had learned, in David's garage, that he could take a broken thing apart and put it back together and that the putting-back-together was worth doing even when the broken thing was himself. James spoke briefly. He said: "David never told me I could do it. He just stood there while I did it. And when I was done, he said, 'See? I told you.' That was his whole thing. That was the whole trick." The congregation laughed, and the laugh was wet, the sound of people laughing through grief, which is a specific sound and one of the few genuinely human sounds that has no equivalent in any other species.

Then Marcus.

He stood up from the seventh row. Amira squeezed his knee. Sara touched his arm. He walked to the front of the church, and his walk was the walk of a man who was not accustomed to walking in front of audiences and who was managing the discomfort by focusing on his feet, one step and then another, the same method he used in the lab when a problem was too large to see whole — reduce it to steps, solve each step, trust that the steps would carry you to the place you needed to be.

He stood at the lectern. He looked at the congregation. Two hundred faces. More. People he did not know. People David had helped. The young men from the shop. DeShawn. Miriam, in the front row, her face held together by will. David's mother, who was crying silently, the tears running into the lines of her face the way water runs into the grain of old wood.

Marcus had written something. He had spent two days writing it, drafting and redrafting in the language of a man who was more comfortable with equations than with sentences and who had never been able to say in words what he could say in a diagram. The written version was in his pocket. He did not take it out. He looked at the congregation and the written version left him, departed his mind the way a bird departs a wire, and what remained was the thing itself, unwritten, unpolished, true in the way that things are true when you stop trying to make them sound a particular way and let them sound like what they are.

"I didn't know David well," he said.

His voice was quiet. Not trained for this. The voice of a man who spent his days talking to graduate students and lab equipment and who had not calibrated for a room this size.

"We met when I was thirty-six. I brought my car to his shop because the alternator was dead, and I didn't know what an alternator was, and David explained it to me while he fixed it. He explained it the way he explained everything — patiently, clearly, without making you feel stupid for not knowing. And while he was explaining, he stopped. He looked at me. And he said, 'I know you.'"

Marcus paused. The pause was not rhetorical. It was the pause of a man who was remembering a moment and finding that the memory was more present than the room.

"I didn't recognize him. I didn't — I want to be honest about that. He remembered me and I didn't remember him, and the reason is that the moment that changed my life was, for David, a Tuesday. It was a thing he did and then he kept going and he didn't think about it for thirty-two years, because that's who David was. He didn't file it. He didn't keep a record. He just did the thing and moved on."

He looked at Miriam. He looked at the young men from the shop.

"David saved my life when I was eight years old. I was drowning in a public pool in Brooklyn. The lifeguard wasn't watching. I went under, and I was going to die. I was eight years old and I was going to die, and David — who was twelve, who didn't know me, who had no reason to do anything — jumped in the water and pulled me out."

The church was quiet. The kind of quiet that has texture.

"He didn't remember my name. He never knew my name. I remembered his face for forty-two years. Every year. I carried it. It was the thing I held onto when I didn't have anything else to hold onto — the fact that a stranger had reached into the water and pulled me out. One moment. One choice. A twelve-year-old who saw a kid drowning and didn't think about it. He just went."

Marcus's voice was not steady. He did not try to make it steady. He was a scientist, and he had learned, in decades of lab work, that precision mattered more than polish, that the accurate representation of a thing was more valuable than the beautiful one.

"David taught me something that I have spent my whole career trying to understand. He taught me that the simplest act — reaching your hand into the water — can echo for forty-two years. Can change a life. Can change a hundred lives, because the life you change goes on to change others, and those others change others, and the math — the math is not simple. The math never was simple. But the act is. David reached in. That's it. That's the whole thing. He saw someone going under and he reached in."

He looked at the congregation one more time. At the two hundred people David had pulled from various kinds of water.

"That's what we do now. That's what he taught all of us. We reach in."

He stepped away from the lectern. He walked back to the seventh row. He sat down. Amira took his hand. Sara put her head on his shoulder. Marcus stared at the back of the pew in front of him and breathed, and the breathing was ragged, the breathing of a man who had just done the hardest thing he had been asked to do and who was now absorbing the cost of it.

The service continued. The choir sang again. Reverend Coleman said the words that pastors say. The congregation filed out in the slow, shuffling rhythm of people leaving a place they did not want to leave because leaving meant the thing was over and the thing being over meant the thing was real.

---

The cemetery was three miles west. The procession moved through Baltimore in a line of headlights, the March sky gray and low, the city moving around the procession the way a river moves around stones — acknowledging the obstruction and continuing. At the cemetery, the graveside was brief. Cold ground. A canopy that snapped in the wind. The casket — the middle one, not the expensive one, not the cheap one — resting on the mechanism that would lower it into the earth. Miriam stood at the edge. She did not speak. She held a single flower — a carnation, white — and she placed it on the casket and stepped back, and the placing was gentle, and the gentleness was the last thing she could give him, and she gave it.

The crowd dispersed slowly. In groups, in pairs, in the halting, reluctant rhythm of people returning to a world that had a hole in it. The young men from the shop clustered near the gate, not ready to leave, talking in low voices, and the talking was not about David — it was about the game last night, about a customer's Camaro, about nothing — and the nothing was how they held each other up, the same way the row houses on Ashland Avenue held each other up, shoulder to shoulder, the shared wall bearing the weight that a single wall could not.

Cassiel stood near the back of the cemetery, by a row of old headstones whose engravings had been smoothed to illegibility by a century of weather. She wore a dark coat. She was unremarkable. That was, and had always been, the point — two hundred and forty-two years of practice at being unremarkable, at existing in spaces without drawing attention, at projecting the particular quality of ordinariness that allowed her to stand at a funeral for a man she had known for decades and be seen by no one.

She had filed David as a case. Not actively — she had never formally intervened. Gabriel had flagged him in 2010, a name on a list, *potential margin case, long-horizon, monitor only.* She had watched him from the margins of the margins, the way she watched many cases that were not technically hers — with the wide-angle attention that was her nature, the instinct to track patterns even when the patterns were not assigned to her. She had watched him get out. She had watched him find the shop. She had watched him build the trade school, brick by brick, student by student, and she had watched the students leave and build their own things, and she had watched the web extend, thread by thread, and she had thought: *this one was never mine. This one was his own.*

The cemetery emptied. The graveside crew waited at a respectful distance, ready to do the mechanical work that followed the ceremonial work. The wind blew. The canopy snapped. The headstones stood in their rows, the names and dates of people who had lived and died in Baltimore, and each headstone was a period at the end of a sentence that no one alive could read anymore.

Cassiel turned to leave and found that she was not alone.

Azrael stood ten feet away, near a maple that had not yet leafed out, its bare branches articulated against the gray sky like a diagram of a nervous system. He was wearing a dark overcoat and the face he wore in the field — mid-fifties, unremarkable, the kind of face that belonged to an accountant or a claims adjuster or any other functionary of the administrative class, a face designed to register and then to be forgotten. He was watching the grave.

He was here because David was a death. David's death was not assigned — not a margin case, not flagged by the monitoring system, not catalogued in anyone's files as an event requiring management. It was just a death. A heart attack, genetic, the kind of cardiac event that was written into the code before birth and that no amount of intervention could rewrite. But Azrael's domain was death itself, all of it, the assigned and the unassigned, the margin cases and the non-margin cases, the deaths that mattered to the system and the deaths that mattered only to the people left behind, and Azrael had come because David Okonkwo had died and Azrael had been present at deaths for over four hundred years and his presence at this one was not a choice but a condition, the way gravity is not a choice but a condition.

They stood in the cemetery, the two of them, near the bare maple, and the graveside crew moved in and began the lowering, and the sound of the mechanism — a low, hydraulic hum — carried across the empty space.

"That wasn't even an assigned case," Azrael said.

His voice was flat. It was always flat. Four hundred years of recording contradictions in a system he no longer believed in had given his voice the particular quality of a man reading minutes at a meeting he did not think should be held. But there was something else in it today. Something underneath the flatness, the way there is something underneath a frozen lake — still, quiet, but present, and warmer than the surface.

"He wasn't assigned," Azrael said again. "No intervention. No nudge. No whisper. No twenty-dollar bill on the sidewalk. He was twelve years old and he saw a kid drowning and he jumped in. And then he did it again. And again. The shop. The students. All of it." He gestured toward the grave, the gesture small, precise. "All of it, and none of it was us."

"They do that sometimes," Cassiel said.

Azrael looked at her. His eyes held four centuries. They held the particular exhaustion of a being who had been keeping records of death since the 1600s and who had, in that time, seen every possible configuration of ending — the violent and the gentle, the sudden and the prolonged, the solitary and the surrounded, the meaningful and the meaningless — and who had concluded, somewhere around the second century of his service, that the categories were less stable than they appeared. The violent deaths were sometimes gentle. The meaningless ones were sometimes the most meaningful. The categories leaked into each other, and the leaking was the point, and the point was something that Azrael had been refusing to acknowledge for a very long time.

"I've been doing this for four hundred and twelve years," he said. "I have watched—" He stopped. He looked at the grave. The casket was in the ground now. The crew was stepping back. The mechanism retracted.

"I have watched humans die in every way a human can die. I have watched them die alone and surrounded. I have watched them die fighting and surrendering. I have watched children die. I have watched—" He stopped again. The stopping was not hesitation. It was the specific mechanical failure of a voice trying to carry a weight that exceeded its engineering.

"I have never understood," he said, "why some of them choose to spend the time between being born and dying pulling other people out of the water."

The sentence hung in the March air. The wind moved it. The bare branches of the maple clicked against each other, a small, dry percussion that sounded like something counting.

Cassiel waited. She had learned, in two hundred and forty-two years, the value of not filling silence.

"Maybe that's the point," Azrael said. The words came slowly. As if they were being extracted from something, the way a fossil is extracted from stone — carefully, with an awareness that the thing being revealed is old and fragile and has been buried for a reason. "We set the stage. They make the play."

Cassiel looked at him. In the flatness of his voice, in the careful, extracted quality of the sentence, she heard something she had never heard from Azrael in the decades she had known him. Not optimism — Azrael was structurally incapable of optimism the way certain buildings are structurally incapable of supporting additional floors. But something adjacent to it. Something that occupied the same neighborhood as hope without having moved into the same house. A recognition. An admission that the records he had been keeping for four hundred years — the records of contradiction and failure and the system's inadequacy — might be incomplete. That there was a column he had not been tracking. A variable he had not included in his models.

The variable was David Okonkwo, who had seen a boy drowning and had jumped in without being told to. Who had jumped in again and again, every day, for twenty years, in a shop on Pratt Street, pulling boys out of water that nobody could see.

"Maybe," Cassiel said.

They stood in the cemetery. The crew finished their work and left. The mound of earth was fresh and dark against the gray grass, and the flowers from the service were arranged on top, their colors sharp in the flat light — white carnations, red roses, a spray of something yellow that Cassiel did not know the name of and that shook in the wind.

Azrael turned up his collar against the cold. He looked at the grave one more time. Then he turned and walked toward the gate, his footsteps quiet on the gravel path, and his walk was the same walk it had always been — measured, unhurried, the walk of a being who had somewhere to be and who would arrive when he arrived — but there was something in his shoulders that had not been there before. A loosening. A fractional release of the tension that four centuries of cynicism had built into the architecture of his body. It was small. It would not have been visible to anyone who was not watching for it.

Cassiel was watching for it.

She stood in the cemetery for a few more minutes after Azrael left. The wind blew. The bare maple clicked. Somewhere beyond the cemetery wall, a car horn sounded, and then another, and then the ordinary layered noise of a city operating at midday — engines and voices and the bass note of a truck on the overpass and a dog and a siren and all of it, all of it continuing, the web of human activity stretching and adjusting around the hole that David's death had made in it.

The web held. It held the way it had always held — not perfectly, not completely, not without gaps and strains and the constant threat of unraveling. But it held. The boys from the shop would go back to the shop and the shop would continue because the shop was not David, the shop was the thing David had built, and the thing he built was stronger than the man who built it, the way a bridge is stronger than the engineer, the way a lesson is stronger than the teacher. DeShawn would open the bay doors tomorrow morning. James would send a customer to the shop next week. The students would teach other students. The web would hold.

Cassiel pulled her coat tighter. The dark coat. The coat of a woman at a funeral, unremarkable, the kind of coat you forgot the moment you looked away. She walked toward the gate. Her footsteps were quiet on the gravel. Behind her, the grave was fresh, and the flowers shook in the wind, and the headstone — which had not yet been placed, which would be placed in six weeks, a simple stone with his name and his dates and the words that Miriam had chosen after three days of trying to say in a sentence what David had been — the headstone was coming, and the words on it would be:

DAVID OKONKWO
1992 - 2042
HE REACHED IN

But for now the grave was just a mound of earth in a cemetery in Baltimore, and the sky was gray, and the wind blew, and somewhere on Pratt Street the shop was closed for the day and would open tomorrow, and somewhere on Ashland Avenue a grandmother was sitting on a porch, and somewhere in a lab a scientist was working on water, and somewhere in a hospital a young doctor was sitting with a patient, and all of it was connected, and all of it was the work, and the work continued, because the work was not the angels' work. It was the humans' work. It had always been the humans' work.

Cassiel walked through the gate and into Baltimore. The city received her the way it received everyone — without ceremony, without notice, with the vast, indifferent hospitality of a place that had been absorbing people and their griefs and their triumphs for three hundred years. She walked, and the walking was ordinary, the footsteps of a woman in a dark coat going home alone, which was what she was, which was what she had always been, and the wind was cold, and the work was the same, and the work was enough.

<!-- AGENT:NOTE — David's death at 50 (born 1992, dies 2042) from genetic heart attack, unpreventable. His last words ("You all saved me more than I saved you") delivered in ambulance to Miriam. Marcus's eulogy is deliberately simple — he's a scientist, not a speechmaker. The pool connection (Ch. 9) pays off here: Marcus held David's face for 42 years (saved at 8 in 2004, now 46 in 2042). Azrael's moment of proto-hope is subtle — not a conversion, not an epiphany, just a loosening, a recognition that his records are incomplete. His line "We set the stage. They make the play" echoes Raziel's "trust them" from Ch. 41 but arrives through Azrael's own voice, from his own evidence. The web imagery connects to the overarching theme: humans saving humans, the cascade of good. DeShawn at 35, working at the shop for 6 years (released ~2027, now 2042). David's headstone inscription ("He reached in") echoes Marcus's eulogy. The final paragraph connects the web: Keisha on the porch (Ch. 42), Marcus in the lab (Ch. 20-21), Sara in the hospital (outline). -->
