# Chapter 40: Try Once More (III)

**February 2035 — St. Michael's Hospital, Queens, New York**

---

The coffee had gone cold an hour ago. Rebecca Morrison drank it anyway, standing at the nurses' station with one hip against the counter and her eyes on the cardiac monitor at the far end of the hall. The coffee was terrible — over-extracted, slightly burnt, brewed from grounds that had been sitting in the canister since the day shift. She had stopped tasting it around hour sixteen. Now, at hour twenty, it was just a delivery mechanism for caffeine, a ritual her hands performed while her brain tried to stay ahead of the exhaustion that had been gaining on her since midnight.

Three AM at St. Michael's. The fluorescent tubes overhead buzzed at a frequency that lived right behind her eyes, turning every surface the same institutional yellow — the linoleum, the walls, the skin of her own hands where they gripped the Styrofoam cup. The lights were the same lights that had been here for decades. The hospital had been renovated twice since the eighties, but the emergency department had kept its original fluorescents, either because the budget didn't stretch that far or because someone in facilities had decided that the ER's particular shade of jaundiced yellow was a tradition worth preserving.

Rebecca was twenty-eight. Second-year resident. Dr. Rebecca Morrison, who had wanted to be a doctor since she was fourteen and watched her mother spend six months reporting on the Takahashi pharmaceutical scandal — sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by documents and legal pads and the cold remains of takeout, making phone calls at midnight, missing dinner, missing weekends, missing everything, because the story was about people dying from contaminated medications and the people who knew about the contamination and did nothing, and Rebecca had watched her mother fight that fight with nothing but a notebook and a phone and a stubbornness that bordered on pathological, and when the story broke and the company fell and the executives were indicted, Rebecca had looked at the newspaper with her mother's byline and thought: *She saves people with words. I want to save them with my hands.*

She had not said this to her mother. She was not a person who said things like that. She was a person who did things quietly, efficiently, without announcement, and then told her mother about them on the phone afterward, when the doing was done and the telling was safe.

Her mother had covered the corruption trial too — the politician, Thomas Reed, the infrastructure contracts, the kickbacks. And the whistleblower, the pharmaceutical executive named Yuki Takahashi, who had risked everything to expose what her company was doing. Rebecca had grown up in a house where the dining table was a war room and the bedtime stories were about accountability and consequences, and when she was eighteen and filling out college applications and her guidance counselor asked what she wanted to do with her life, she had said "medicine" without hesitation, because medicine was the version of her mother's work that used hands instead of words. The same impulse. The same stubbornness. A different instrument.

Now she stood at the nurses' station and watched the monitors and drank the terrible coffee and thought about sleep. Not about sleeping — about the concept of sleep, the way a thirsty person thinks about water as an abstraction, knowing the actual thing is unavailable. She had been on since seven the previous morning. Eighteen hours of patients — a broken arm, two chest pains that turned out to be anxiety, a kid with a fishhook in his thumb, an elderly woman with a UTI who had wanted, more than antibiotics, someone to sit with her for five minutes and listen, and Rebecca had sat and listened because Sarah had taught her that listening was medicine too, that the body healed faster when the person inside it felt heard.

Sarah. Dr. Sarah Morrison. Not Rebecca's grandmother — no relation, though the shared surname had produced confusion at the nurses' station more than once and Rebecca had stopped correcting it, not because she wanted the association but because the association was, in its way, accurate. Sarah was family in the way that matters more than blood: the kind of family you choose by apprenticeship, by imitation, by the slow absorption of someone else's way of being until it becomes indistinguishable from your own.

Sarah was seventy-eight. She had been at St. Michael's for fifty years — as a resident, an attending, chief of medicine, and now emeritus, a title that meant, officially, that she had retired and, in practice, that she had simply changed the frequency of her presence from daily to whenever she felt like it, which was most days. She walked the halls slowly now. Her knees had been replaced, both of them, and the replacements were good but not as good as the originals had been at their best, and she compensated by moving with a deliberate, measured pace that made every step look intentional, as if she were walking that slowly on purpose, which, knowing Sarah, she might have been.

Her mind was sharp. Her hands shook — a fine tremor, the kind that came with age and too many years of coffee and the accumulated stress of a career spent making decisions at three in the morning — but her eyes were clear and her diagnostic instinct was intact, the product of sixty years of pattern recognition that no amount of tremor could degrade. She still taught. She stood at bedsides and watched residents work and offered comments that were brief and precise and delivered in the flat, unvarnished tone of a woman who had been through enough to know that gentleness was a luxury and clarity was a necessity.

She had told Rebecca the same thing she told every resident. She told it the way other people told their children to look both ways before crossing the street — as a piece of foundational wisdom so basic that it could be delivered without emphasis, without drama, in the same tone you'd use to note that it was raining.

"Always try once more. You never know what a life might do."

Rebecca had heard it a hundred times. She had heard it in the break room and at the bedside and in the hallway outside the room where a patient had just died and the monitor was still beeping its flat, accusatory tone. She had heard it so many times that the words had passed through the phase of being advice and entered the phase of being architecture — part of the structure of how she practiced, load-bearing, invisible.

She finished the coffee. She set the cup on the counter. The ER was quiet in the way that ERs are quiet at three AM — not silent, never silent, but running at low idle, the machinery of the department humming along on its overnight staffing: two residents, one attending (asleep in the call room), three nurses, a security guard named Hector who was reading a paperback at the front desk.

Then the radio crackled.

---

The call came in at 3:14. Male, mid-forties, found unresponsive on a bench outside the Lexington Avenue subway station. No pulse. Bystander CPR in progress. ETA four minutes.

Rebecca put down the coffee cup. Her body knew what to do before her mind had finished processing the words — the shift in posture, the hands moving to check that her stethoscope was where it should be, the feet already carrying her toward the trauma bay. The transition from tired to ready happened without her permission, the way a pilot's hands find the controls in turbulence, the training taking over the space that exhaustion had occupied.

The trauma bay was cold. It was always cold, the temperature kept low because the equipment generated heat and the bodies of the people working generated heat and the work itself — the compressions, the rushing, the controlled urgency of a code — generated enough thermal energy that a warm room became unbearable within minutes. Rebecca pulled on gloves. The latex snapped against her wrists.

The paramedics came through the doors at 3:18. Two of them, moving fast, the gurney between them, and on the gurney was a man.

He was mid-forties, as the radio had said. He was thin in a way that spoke of deprivation rather than choice — the thinness of someone who did not eat regularly, whose body had begun the process of consuming its own reserves. He wore a coat that had been decent once and was now filthy, the fabric darkened with ground-in dirt, one pocket torn, the zipper broken. Under the coat, a flannel shirt that was too large for him. Under the shirt, a body that the paramedics had already exposed for the electrode pads — a chest that was pale and bruised and marked with the particular geography of a life lived outdoors: old scars, a rash across the sternum, the visible ridges of ribs.

His hands were calloused. Not work calluses — the calluses of someone who slept on concrete and gripped the edges of benches and shelters and the hard surfaces of a world that offered no softness. His face was unshaven, the stubble patchy and gray, and his hair was matted and long and pushed back from a forehead that was broad and surprisingly unwrinkled, as if the face beneath the dirt and the hair and the stubble were younger than the rest of him, or older, or operating on a different timeline entirely.

His eyes were open. Red-rimmed, the conjunctiva inflamed from exposure and sleeplessness and something else — they looked like the eyes of a person who had been crying for a long time, not in the way that people cry from sadness but in the way that wind and cold and years of looking at things that hurt will make the eyes produce tears as a matter of defense.

The eyes were not seeing anything. The man was in cardiac arrest.

"How long has he been down?" Rebecca asked.

"Bystander found him fifteen minutes ago, started compressions. We've been running the code for eight minutes. Epi times two. Shocked twice, no response. PEA, then V-fib, now asystole."

Asystole. A flat line. The heart had stopped not in the dramatic, defibrillatable way of ventricular fibrillation — the shaking, disorganized electrical storm that could sometimes be reset with a shock — but in the absolute way. The electrical system had simply quit. No rhythm. No signal. No argument from the muscle about whether it wanted to keep going. Just silence.

"Resume compressions," Rebecca said.

The paramedic stepped aside. Carlos, the nurse, took over — a big man with steady hands who compressed with the metronome precision of someone who had done this thousands of times and had learned that the quality of the compression mattered more than the force, that the chest needed to recoil fully between each push, that the rate needed to stay between a hundred and a hundred and twenty, that the depth needed to be at least two inches, and that all of this mechanical discipline was, in the end, a way of pretending to be a heart until the real heart decided whether to come back.

Rebecca looked at the monitor. Flat. The green line traveled from left to right without deviation, a graph of nothing, the visual representation of a machine measuring an absence.

"Epi, one milligram, IV push."

The drug went in. They waited. The compressions continued, Carlos's gloved hands on the sternum, the gurney rocking slightly with each push.

Nothing.

"Charge to two hundred," Rebecca said. She knew the asystole made defibrillation unlikely to work — you could not restart a rhythm that did not exist; you could only reset a rhythm that was there but disorganized. But the protocols allowed for it in certain cases, and Rebecca was not ready to accept the flatline as the final word.

"Charged."

"Clear."

The body jumped. The monitor showed artifact — the wild scribble of electricity passing through tissue — and then settled back to the flat line. Asystole. The heart had heard the shock and had nothing to say in response.

"Resume compressions."

"How long?" Carlos asked. Not a challenge. A genuine question, delivered in the neutral tone of a nurse who had worked enough codes to know that the question was legitimate and that the answer was not in the protocol but in the doctor.

Rebecca looked at the clock. Twenty-three minutes since the bystander had found him. Fifteen since the paramedics had arrived. The math was not in the man's favor. Asystole of this duration, in a patient with no known history and no available medical records and no one waiting in the hallway to tell them about allergies or medications or the biography of this heart — the math said stop.

"ID?" she asked.

"Nothing. No wallet, no phone, no cards. We checked."

A man with no name and no history and no one to claim him, lying on a gurney in an emergency room at three in the morning, his heart a flat line and his red-rimmed eyes staring at the fluorescent ceiling that looked the same in 2035 as it had in 1985, the same yellow, the same buzz, the same light falling on the same linoleum in the same hospital where a twenty-eight-year-old resident had once stood over a seventy-one-year-old woman and decided, for no reason she could articulate, to place the paddles one more time.

The nurses exchanged a look. Rebecca saw it — the lateral glance, the brief communication that happened below the level of speech, the look that meant *it's time* and *he's gone* and *the young doctor doesn't know when to stop*.

She knew the look. She had been trained to recognize it by a woman who had been on the receiving end of that look fifty years ago and had ignored it.

"One more round," Rebecca said.

Carlos looked at her. His hands were still on the chest, paused between compressions, waiting for the word.

"Epi, push another round. Charge to three-sixty."

"Doctor — " This from Janet, the charge nurse, a woman in her fifties who had been at St. Michael's for twenty-five years and who spoke with the measured authority of someone who had watched many young doctors learn the difference between persistence and futility. "We've been running this code for — "

"I know how long we've been running it." Rebecca did not raise her voice. She said it the way Sarah said things — flat, clear, without emphasis, the tone of a person who was not arguing because there was nothing to argue about. "One more round."

Janet pressed her lips together. She drew up the epinephrine. Carlos resumed compressions. The defibrillator began its climb toward three hundred and sixty joules, the whine high and thin, a sound that Rebecca had heard a thousand times and that still, every time, produced in her the same involuntary response — a tightening of the hands, a narrowing of the focus, the body's preparation for the moment when electricity would pass through another body and the monitor would either change or not change and either way the next three seconds would mean something.

"Epi's in."

"Charged."

"Clear."

She placed the paddles on the man's chest. The chest was thin enough that she could feel the ribs through the paddles, the hard cage of bone that protected the organ that had stopped working, and she pressed the buttons and the body jumped and the monitor showed artifact.

Rebecca watched the screen. The artifact cleared. The line returned. Flat. Asystole. The heart had nothing to say.

She watched for three seconds. Five. Seven. The line was flat and the room was quiet and Carlos's hands were hovering above the chest, waiting, and Janet was standing with the chart, and the clock on the wall said 3:27 and the fluorescents buzzed and the man on the gurney was dead.

"Time," Rebecca said. She heard her own voice. It sounded like someone else's. "Time of death — "

She stopped.

Not because of a sound. Not because of a voice. Not because of anything she could describe or would ever be able to describe, not to her mother on the phone tonight, not to the residents she would someday train, not to anyone who asked her what happened in Trauma Bay 2 at St. Michael's Hospital on a February night in 2035. What happened was that she stopped. She was speaking the words *time of death* and between the word *death* and the next breath she stopped, and in the space where the next breath should have been there was something — not a whisper, not a thought, not an intuition — something that had no name and occupied no category in the taxonomy of her training, something that existed in the gap between the decision to stop and the decision to continue, and it said nothing, and it said everything, and what it said was:

*Try once more.*

Sarah's voice. Except it was not Sarah's voice. It was not any voice. It was the architecture of a philosophy that had traveled from a twenty-eight-year-old resident's mouth in 1985 to a seventy-eight-year-old teacher's mouth in 2034 to the structure of Rebecca Morrison's practice in 2035, and it was not a sound but a pattern, the way a heartbeat is not a sound but a pattern, and the pattern said *again*.

"One more," Rebecca said.

Janet looked up from the chart. "Doctor?"

"One more round. Push epi. Charge to three-sixty."

The look again. The lateral glance. But Janet set down the pen and Carlos placed his hands on the sternum and the defibrillator began its climb, and Rebecca stood at the bedside and watched the flat line on the monitor with the absolute, total attention of a woman who had nothing left to justify what she was doing — no protocol, no evidence, no reason that would survive a morbidity and mortality review — nothing except the inherited stubbornness of a chain of women who had passed a sentence from one to the next like a baton in a relay that had been running for fifty years.

"Epi's in."

"Charged."

"Clear."

The body jumped. The monitor showed artifact. The artifact cleared.

The line organized.

Not a flat line. Not asystole. A rhythm — weak, irregular, feeling its way forward the way a person feels their way through a dark room, hands out, testing each step. But a rhythm. An electrical signal traveling through the cardiac muscle and producing, at the end of its journey, a contraction. A heartbeat.

"Sinus," Carlos said. His voice had changed. The neutrality was gone, replaced by something rawer. "Sinus rhythm. Rate — forty-four. Forty-six."

Rebecca watched the numbers. Heart rate climbing. Forty-eight. Fifty. Blood pressure registering — low, dangerously low, but registering. Oxygen saturation appearing on the pulse ox: eighty-four. Eighty-six. Eighty-nine.

"He's back," Janet said. She said it quietly, the way people say things when the thing they are saying is too large for the voice they are saying it in.

Rebecca placed her stethoscope on the man's chest. She listened. The heart was there — tentative, uncertain, but there, the way a voice is there when someone speaks from the other side of a wall, muffled and distant but undeniably present. She moved the stethoscope. Breath sounds, bilateral. The lungs had decided to participate.

"Okay," Rebecca said. Her voice was not steady. "Twelve-lead. ABG. Chest X-ray. Continuous monitoring. I want vitals every five minutes."

She pulled off her gloves. Her hands were shaking. She let them shake.

---

The man woke at 6:47 AM.

Rebecca was at the nurses' station, writing notes, when Carlos came to tell her. She walked to the room — they had moved him from the trauma bay to a bed in the cardiac unit — and she stood in the doorway and looked at the man who had been dead forty minutes ago and was now alive.

He was sitting up. Not fully — the bed was raised to thirty degrees and he was leaning against it, his body making the small, tentative adjustments of a person who has been unconscious and is re-learning the physics of being upright. His eyes were open. They were still red-rimmed, still inflamed, but they were focused now, tracking the room with a slow, scanning attention that Rebecca recognized from other patients who had woken from cardiac arrest — the disorientation of a mind that had been absent and was now trying to match the world it remembered with the world it was seeing.

But there was something else in the eyes. Something that was not disorientation. The man was looking at the room — the monitors, the IV pole, the window with its view of the hospital parking lot and the gray February sky — and his expression was not confusion. It was surprise. The surprise of a person who has expected one thing and received another, who has prepared for an outcome that did not occur.

"Good morning," Rebecca said. "I'm Dr. Morrison. You're at St. Michael's Hospital. You had a cardiac arrest. We resuscitated you."

The man looked at her. His eyes moved across her face the way a reader's eyes move across a page — left to right, top to bottom, taking in the information, processing it. When he spoke, his voice was rough, the voice of a man who had not used it in a long time, but the words came with a precision that surprised her.

"I wasn't supposed to survive," he said.

Rebecca had heard many things from patients waking from cardiac arrest. She had heard confusion, gratitude, anger, fear, the full spectrum of responses that a mind produces when it learns that it has returned from the place where minds do not return from. She had not heard this. The sentence was not despairing. It was not suicidal. It was factual, spoken in the flat tone of someone reporting an outcome that had deviated from a prediction.

"You did survive," she said. "Your heart stopped for over twenty minutes. We brought it back."

"Why?"

She did not understand the question at first. It was not the *why me* of existential crisis or the *why bother* of depression. It was a genuine question, delivered with genuine curiosity, as if the man were asking about a mechanism he had not anticipated.

"Because that's what we do," Rebecca said. "We try."

The man looked at her for a long time. His red-rimmed eyes held an expression she could not read — not gratitude, not anger, not the blankness of dissociation. Something deeper and stranger, something that looked like a very old question being answered by a very new fact.

"You tried once more," he said.

Rebecca felt something move through her — a current, a recognition. He had not been in the room when she said it. He had been dead when she said it. He could not have heard the words.

"Yes," she said. "I tried once more."

The man closed his eyes. He leaned back against the bed. His hands — the calloused, weather-beaten hands — lay on the blanket, and they were shaking, not with cold or weakness but with something else, a tremor that started deep and worked its way outward, the physical expression of a system under revision.

"Nine hundred years," he said, so quietly that Rebecca was not sure she had heard him correctly.

"I'm sorry?"

He opened his eyes. "Nothing. I'm tired."

"You should rest. We'll need to run some tests. Do you have someone we can call? Family?"

A long pause. The monitors beeped. The February light came through the window, thin and gray, and fell across the bed in a pale rectangle that did not reach the man's face.

"No," he said. "There's no one to call."

---

He discharged himself the next morning. Against medical advice — Rebecca tried to stop him. She stood in the doorway of his room with the AMA form in her hand and told him that his heart had been stopped for over twenty minutes and that they needed to run an echocardiogram and a cardiac catheterization and that leaving now was dangerous, genuinely dangerous, that the heart could stop again and that next time there might not be a doctor who tried once more.

He signed the form. His signature was illegible — not the illegibility of haste but of something else, as if the hand that held the pen were accustomed to writing in a script that the form did not accommodate.

He stood. He was taller than she had realized — six feet, maybe more, the height hidden by the hospital bed's scale. He put on his filthy coat and his too-large flannel shirt and he looked at Rebecca with the red-rimmed eyes that had not stopped looking like they had been crying for a very long time, and he said:

"Thank you."

"Please stay," she said. "We can help."

"You already did."

He walked down the hall. She watched him go — the slow, deliberate steps of a man who was relearning how to walk, not because his body had forgotten but because the body's relationship to the act of walking had changed, as if the ground beneath his feet were different ground than the ground he had been walking on before, and each step required a recalibration.

He pushed through the exit. The February cold came in through the opened door, a brief exhalation of winter, and then the door closed and he was gone.

Rebecca stood in the hallway and looked at the closed door and felt the frustration of a doctor who has saved a life and cannot save the life that comes after — the next meal, the next night on a bench, the next winter, the ongoing cascade of needs that a single resuscitation could not address.

She did not know what she had saved. She did not know that the man in the filthy coat was nine hundred years old, that his name was Puriel, that his title was the Angel of Punishment and Examiner of Souls, that he had spent nine centuries working the cases that no other angel wanted — the addicts, the recidivists, the people whose margin cases came back again and again like a tide that would not stop rising. She did not know that he had been an Abolitionist, a cynic, a meticulous documenter of the system's failures, filling reports that read like indictments, cataloguing every margin case that failed, every intervention that came too late, every human who fell through the gap between what the system promised and what it delivered. She did not know that he had come to St. Michael's not as a patient but as an experiment — that he had deliberately pushed himself to the edge of mortality, testing the question that had been consuming him for a century: if the system did not matter, if the angels' work was futile and the margins were an illusion and human suffering was a problem without a solution, then did the angels themselves matter? Could they die? Would anyone try to save them?

She did not know that a human had answered his question. That a twenty-eight-year-old resident with inherited stubbornness and a philosophy borrowed from a seventy-eight-year-old teacher who had borrowed it from a whisper she heard at three in the morning fifty years ago had placed the paddles on his chest and pressed the buttons and said *one more round* and the one more round had been enough.

She did not know that Puriel walked out of St. Michael's Hospital and stood on the sidewalk in the February cold and looked at the sky and felt something he had not felt in three hundred years, which was not faith exactly and not hope exactly but something more fundamental — the recognition that he had been wrong. Not wrong about the failures. The failures were real. The addicts who relapsed, the interventions that came too late, the margin cases that fell on the wrong side — these were real and documented and Puriel's records were accurate. But the conclusion he had drawn from the evidence was wrong. The conclusion had been: the system doesn't work, therefore the system doesn't matter. The conclusion should have been: the system doesn't always work, and it matters anyway.

A human had saved him. Not an angel. Not the system. A human woman with no knowledge of what he was, operating on nothing but a borrowed philosophy and the stubbornness to try one more time when every metric said to stop. She had not saved him because he was an angel. She had saved him because he was a body on a gurney with no pulse and no name and no one to claim him, and she had decided that the absence of all those things was not a reason to stop trying.

He stood on the sidewalk and the cold pressed against him and he thought about nine hundred years of reports, nine hundred years of documented failures, and he thought about the woman in the trauma bay who had said *one more round* to a room that had already given up, and he thought: *The math doesn't work. The math has never worked. And they do it anyway.*

He went back to the field. He did not go back as an Abolitionist. He did not go back as a cynic or a documenter of failures or a man waiting for the system to collapse. He went back as something else — something that did not have a name in the faction taxonomy, something that might have been called faith if the word had not been so thoroughly colonized by certainty. What Puriel felt was not certainty. It was the opposite of certainty. It was the willingness to continue in the absence of certainty, to work the cases and hold the margins and do the labor without knowing whether the labor mattered, because a human woman had done exactly that for him, and the doing had been enough.

One Abolitionist became an Evolutionist. Not because the evidence changed. Because the question changed. The question was no longer *does the system work?* The question was *does the trying matter?* And to that question, Puriel's own restarted heart was the answer.

---

Rebecca went home that night. Her shift ended at seven AM, but she stayed until noon, finishing notes, checking on patients, doing the administrative work that filled the gaps between the moments that mattered. She was tired in the way that residents were always tired — not the tiredness of a single shift but the cumulative tiredness of two years of shifts, the bone-deep fatigue that lived in her like the fluorescent buzz in the hospital walls, constant and unnoticed until she stopped moving long enough to hear it.

She drove to her apartment. She showered. She ate something — toast, she thought, or cereal, the food of people too tired to cook and too hungry to skip the meal. She sat on her couch in sweatpants and a T-shirt with her hair wet and her feet bare on the carpet and she picked up her phone and called her mother.

Her mother answered on the second ring. She always answered on the second ring, a habit from the years of reporting when a phone call could be a source or a tip or a threat, and the second ring was the compromise between eagerness and composure.

"Hey, sweetheart."

"Hi, Mom."

"How was your shift?"

Rebecca looked at the ceiling. The ceiling was white and featureless and told her nothing, the way hospital ceilings told patients nothing, as the sky tells no one anything when they look up and ask it questions.

"I saved someone today," she said.

A pause. Rebecca could hear her mother shift — the sound of a body adjusting in a chair, the creak of the seat, the quality of attention that her mother brought to listening, the journalist's attention, the attention that treated every sentence as a lead that might open into something larger.

"Tell me about it," her mother said.

Rebecca told her. She told her about the man with no name and the cardiac arrest and the twenty-three minutes and the nurses' look and the moment when she said *time of death* and stopped. She told her about the last round, the paddles, the shock, the flat line that organized into a rhythm. She told her about the man waking and saying *I wasn't supposed to survive*. She told her about the AMA discharge and the filthy coat and the signed form and the man walking down the hall and out the door and into the February cold.

She did not tell her mother about the thing she had felt in the gap between *death* and the next breath, because she did not have words for it. She did not tell her about Sarah's philosophy or the chain of inheritance that connected a whisper in 1985 to a decision in 2035, because the chain was invisible to her — she knew only her own link, the place where the philosophy lived in her practice, and the rest of the chain extended backward and forward into a darkness she could not see.

Her mother listened. She listened the way she had always listened — completely, without interruption, with the patience of a woman who had spent her career extracting stories from people and had learned that the most important part of any story was the part the teller was not yet ready to say.

When Rebecca finished, her mother was quiet for a moment. Then she said:

"You know what I think?"

"What?"

"I think you became a doctor for the same reason I became a journalist. Because somebody has to try once more."

Rebecca closed her eyes. She pressed the phone against her ear. Her mother's voice was warm and steady and carried the quality of a woman who had spent her life fighting for things that mattered and had learned, over decades, that the fighting was the point — not the winning, not the outcome, but the willingness to keep going when the story was hard and the sources were reluctant and the truth was expensive and the alternative to trying was accepting that the world was what it was and would not be moved.

"I love you, Mom."

"I love you too, sweetheart. Get some sleep."

Rebecca hung up. She set the phone on the couch cushion. She looked at her hands — the hands that had placed the paddles, the hands that had pressed the buttons, the hands that had held a stranger's heart between stopping and starting and had chosen starting. Her hands were steady now. The shaking had stopped somewhere between the hospital and home, the tremor burned off by the drive and the shower and the ritual of calling her mother, which was its own kind of medicine.

She lay down on the couch. The apartment was quiet. Outside, the February wind pressed against the windows, and the traffic on the street below moved in the rhythm that cities maintain at all hours, the low constant pulse of a system that does not stop, and Rebecca Morrison closed her eyes and slept, and the sleep was heavy and dreamless and complete, the sleep of a person who has done the one thing she was trained to do and done it well and does not yet know — cannot know, will never know — the full consequence of having done it.

The patient was alive. The patient was walking somewhere in the February cold, alive, restarted, revised. And the philosophy that had restarted him — *try once more* — was traveling still, forward and backward through time, carried by women who did not know each other and would never meet, each one a link in a chain that had begun with a whisper in a hospital room at three in the morning and would continue, link by link, into a future that none of them could see and all of them were building.
