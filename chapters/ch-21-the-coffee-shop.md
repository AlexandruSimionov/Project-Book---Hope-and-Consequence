# Chapter 21: The Coffee Shop

**September 2024 — Linnea's Coffee, West Philadelphia**

---

Cassiel had been watching Marcus Chen for eleven weeks.

Not continuously — she was not that kind of angel, and the protocols did not permit that kind of surveillance, though the protocols permitted less and less these days and the line between observation and intrusion had been redrawn so many times that the original border was no longer visible. Eleven weeks of intermittent contact. A presence in the back of a lecture hall where Marcus was the only audience member, listening to a visiting hydrologist whose talk had been scheduled for a room of sixty and drawn a crowd of seven. A figure on a bench outside the Pennington Engineering Building, reading a newspaper she was not reading, watching Marcus walk in at 7 AM and walk out at 11 PM and noting, with the clinical patience that two centuries of fieldwork had given her, the progressive dimming of a man who was running out of light.

She had read his file. She had read all their files — all seven of the Cascade-7 cases, the thick dossiers that Gabriel had assembled before his death and that now sat in her apartment in Queens in a cardboard box that she should have returned to the 3rd Heaven archives and had not, because Gabriel had wanted her to have them and because Gabriel's wants, even posthumous ones, carried a weight that institutional procedure could not counterbalance. Marcus's file was the fourth she had opened. It was ninety-three pages, which was short for a margin case — Keisha Williams's ran to two hundred and forty, and David Okonkwo's, with its prison years and parole records and the labyrinthine connections to Thomas Reed's prosecutorial career, was three hundred and eleven. Marcus's was ninety-three pages of a life that was, in its outward dimensions, unremarkable: born 1996, Philadelphia, single mother, public schools, scholarship to state university, PhD program, research into water filtration. No criminal record. No substance abuse. No history of violence or domestic instability beyond the ordinary instability of being human and poor and trying to do something that the world had not asked for.

The file did not explain why his case mattered. The files never did. They assembled facts — dates, relationships, financial records, the web of connections that the 4th Heaven's pattern analysts had traced between this life and the other six — and they left the field agent to understand the rest. The rest, in Marcus Chen's case, was this: his research, if completed and published and made freely available, would provide the foundational technology for low-cost arsenic filtration in developing nations, a technology that would be adopted first in Bangladesh, then in parts of India and sub-Saharan Africa, then — through a chain of adaptation and improvement that the pattern models projected forward with the qualified confidence of all long-range forecasting — in water reclamation systems that would enable human settlement on Mars in the twenty-third century.

Cassiel did not think about Mars. She had learned, in two hundred years, not to think about the long trajectories. The long trajectories were seductive and paralyzing in equal measure — they made every case feel cosmically important, which was true, and they made every failure feel cosmically catastrophic, which was also true, and between the importance and the catastrophe there was no room for the thing she actually needed, which was the ability to sit in a coffee shop on a Thursday morning and have a conversation with a man who was about to give up.

<!-- AGENT:NOTE — Cassiel's internal conflict: cosmic perspective vs. individual encounter. This mirrors her arc from isolated exhaustion to connected purpose. The Cascade-7 protocol requires her to manage seven simultaneous crises; she must choose presence over omniscience. -->

She arrived at Linnea's Coffee at 8:15 in the morning, which was twenty minutes before Marcus would arrive, based on eleven weeks of observation that had taught her his patterns — the patterns he maintained and the patterns he was breaking. When his advisor was alive, Marcus had gone to the lab by 7:30 every morning, a regularity that Cassiel recognized as the behavior of a man who needed structure the way some people need medication, not because the structure made him happy but because without it the alternative was formless and the formless was where the drowning happened. Since Whitfield's death, the patterns had disintegrated. Marcus woke later. He went to the lab less. He spent hours at his desk, staring at documents, the particular stillness of a person paralyzed by options that all felt like losses. The balcony time had increased. Cassiel had watched him stand there, hands on the railing, and she had felt the margin tighten the way you feel a change in air pressure — not with any single sense but with the whole body, a shift in the weight of the possible.

He was not suicidal. She had assessed this early, with the cold precision that the work demanded, and the assessment had held. Marcus Chen did not want to die. He wanted his life to make sense, and the paths available to him had diverged into a choice between meaninglessness and comfort on one hand and meaninglessness and poverty on the other, and the third path — the one where the research continued and the work found traction and the membrane technology reached the people who needed it — had been walled off by three grant rejections and a dead advisor and a department that was already converting his lab into office space.

The margin was not life or death. The margin was purpose. Whether Marcus Chen would continue to be the person capable of doing the thing only he could do — or whether he would sign a letter and become someone else, someone competent and employed and diminished in a way that would not show up in any measurable metric but that would close a door the world could not afford to have closed.

Cassiel ordered black coffee. She carried it to a table near the window, a two-top with a wobbling leg that she steadied with a folded napkin, and she sat down.

The coffee shop was the kind of place that had survived gentrification by being too shabby to attract the renovators and too good to lose its regulars. The walls were exposed brick, water-stained, hung with student art that changed monthly and was uniformly mediocre. The floor was wide-plank pine, scuffed and uneven, bearing the archaeological record of decades of foot traffic. The espresso machine — an ancient two-group La Marzocco that someone had repaired so many times it was more aftermarket parts than original — hissed and steamed behind the counter like a small, domesticated dragon. The music was jazz, turned low, a muted trumpet wandering through changes that sounded like thinking.

Cassiel liked this place. She had been coming here for months, establishing herself as a regular, a woman who ordered black coffee and read and did not require conversation — building the cover that the Subtlety Protocols demanded. She was, to the barista, to the other regulars, to anyone who glanced in her direction, an unremarkable woman in her mid-thirties with dark hair and the tired eyes of someone who worked too much. This was, in every functional sense, accurate.

She drank her coffee. She waited.

At 8:34 — six minutes later than his average — Marcus came through the door.

He looked worse than yesterday. This was specific, not impressionistic: the set of his shoulders had shifted forward, a postural collapse that communicated defeat as clearly as a white flag; the skin beneath his eyes was darker, the capillary flush of a person who had slept badly or not enough; he moved through the space with the disoriented caution of someone in an unfamiliar room, though he had been here dozens of times. He ordered at the counter — drip coffee, large, no room for cream — and carried it to a table three rows from Cassiel's, near the back wall, where the light from the window didn't quite reach.

He opened his laptop. He stared at the screen. He did not type.

Cassiel watched him for four minutes. This was the protocol: observe, assess, choose the entry point. The intervention had to be organic. It had to feel, to Marcus and to anyone watching, like the kind of coincidence that happens in coffee shops — a stranger's comment, a shared observation, the social friction that occurs when two people occupy adjacent space and the silence between them develops a weight that one of them decides to break. It could not feel engineered. The moment it felt engineered, the subject's defenses would engage, the analytical mind would categorize the interaction as manipulation, and the margin window would narrow to nothing.

Two hundred and twelve years of this. Two hundred and twelve years of conversations that had to feel accidental, of questions that had to sound casual, of the particular discipline required to know exactly what a person needed to hear and to find a way to make them hear it without ever appearing to have intended it. Bus stops. Hospital waiting rooms. Subway platforms. Park benches. Jury duty. Grocery store checkout lines. The whole accumulated geography of human proximity, every place where strangers shared space and occasionally, unpredictably, spoke to each other — these were her operating theater, and the surgery was always the same: open the door without letting the patient see your hands.

She had been good at this once. She was still good at it, technically. The skills had not degraded. But something behind the skills had — the faith, maybe, or the stamina, or the capacity to believe that one conversation in a coffee shop could counterbalance the forces arrayed against a single human life. Grant agencies. Institutional inertia. Student debt. A healthcare system that made a mother's hip replacement a financial crisis. The defense industry, which could find $2 million for weapons research without blinking but could not find $200,000 for clean water. Cassiel could nudge. She could not dismantle.

She picked up her coffee. She stood. She walked to the counter for a refill she did not need, passing Marcus's table, and on the return trip she paused — naturally, the way a person pauses when they notice something — and looked at his screen.

"Langmuir isotherms?"

Marcus looked up. His expression was the blank hostility of a person interrupted in private misery, and Cassiel held it without flinching, the way you hold a gaze with a dog that hasn't decided yet whether to trust you.

"Sorry," she said. "I wasn't trying to read your screen. My advisor used to work with Langmuir models. The graphs are distinctive."

This was true. Every word of it was true. The Subtlety Protocols did not prohibit truth — they prohibited the kind of truth that could not be explained by natural means, the miraculous truth, the truth that arrived from outside the system. What Cassiel offered was a smaller truth: that she recognized the shape of the graph on Marcus's screen because she had, in fact, worked with a researcher — Whitfield's doctoral advisor, three decades ago, a different case, a different margin — who used the same models. The connection was real. She simply omitted the context.

"It's fine," Marcus said, in the tone that means *it's not fine, go away.*

Cassiel did not go away. She did not sit down, either. She stood holding her coffee, at the distance that social convention designated as the boundary between engagement and intrusion — close enough to speak without raising her voice, far enough that turning away would not be rude.

"Adsorption kinetics?" she asked.

Marcus looked at her more carefully. The analytical mind — the thing that made him a scientist, the thing that was both his greatest asset and the mechanism of his current paralysis — engaged. She could see it happen, the shift from *who is this person* to *does this person know what they're talking about*.

"Selective binding," he said. "Arsenic. Arsenate, specifically."

"In water systems?"

"Yeah."

"Published work, or — ?"

"Dissertation." He said it the way you say the name of someone who has recently disappointed you.

"Environmental engineering?"

Marcus nodded. He was waiting for the question that always came next — *what's the application*, followed by the glazed look that appeared when the answer was *rural water filtration in developing nations* rather than something with commercial potential. Cassiel knew this because she had watched him answer the question thirty times in eleven weeks, at departmental functions and funding mixers and in conversations with family members who wanted to understand what he did and couldn't, quite, grasp why a smart person would spend four years on something that would never make money.

She did not ask about the application. She asked about the chemistry.

"What's your sorbent material?"

Marcus blinked. "Iron-oxide nanoparticles. Embedded in a polymer matrix."

"What polymer?"

"Recycled PET. Modified. We're — I'm using a phase-inversion process to create an asymmetric membrane with a selective skin layer." He paused. The pronoun shift — *we're* to *I'm* — sat between them like a dropped glass, and Marcus heard it but did not address it. "The idea is you get the selectivity of a nanomaterial with the structural integrity of a polymer membrane, at a cost low enough for deployment in communities that can't afford conventional treatment."

Cassiel sat down.

She did not ask permission. She sat down in the chair across from him, the way a person who is interested in a conversation sits down, the way a colleague sits down, the way — and this was the calculation, the tiny, precise act of social engineering that two centuries had taught her — a person who takes your work seriously sits down. Not politely. Not tentatively. With the directness of someone who has heard something worth hearing and intends to hear more.

"How low is low enough?" she said.

Marcus looked at her. The hostility had dissolved into something else — not warmth, not trust, but the tentative alertness of a person who has been speaking into a void and has heard an echo. "Our target was eleven cents per unit. Membrane unit, not per liter — each membrane has a throughput of about fifty liters per day with a replacement cycle of six months."

"Eleven cents." Cassiel turned the number over. "What's the current best alternative?"

"Depends on the context. For community-scale systems in Bangladesh — that's where the need is greatest, 77 million people above the WHO guideline — the cheapest effective option is SONO filtration, which runs about eight to twelve dollars per unit with lower throughput. Or you can do coagulation-flocculation with ferric chloride, but that requires a trained operator and a supply chain for the reagent, which doesn't exist in most of the villages that need it."

He was talking faster now. Cassiel recognized this — the acceleration that happens when a person who has been carrying specialized knowledge in isolation is given an audience that can receive it. It was not excitement, exactly. It was relief. The relief of transmission.

"So you're looking at a cost reduction of roughly two orders of magnitude," she said.

"If it scales. That's the question. Lab results are promising. Bench-scale testing shows ninety-seven percent arsenic removal from concentrations up to 500 parts per billion, which is well above what you'd see in most contaminated groundwater. But we haven't done field testing. We haven't done durability testing under real-world conditions — temperature variation, particulate loading, biofouling. We haven't—" He stopped. "I don't know why I'm telling you this."

"Because you know what you're talking about," Cassiel said. "And I'm asking."

Marcus sat back. He looked at her — really looked, for the first time, with the direct appraisal of a person trying to place a stranger in the taxonomy of their experience. She let him look. She had a face that invited looking and forgot easily, which was useful in this work — regular features, brown eyes, the kind of appearance that people described afterward in generalities (*she was, I don't know, average height, dark hair*) because there was nothing to anchor a specific memory. She wore a dark sweater and jeans. No jewelry. No distinguishing marks. The camouflage of the unremarkable.

"Do you work in water?" he asked.

"No. I work in — consulting, I guess you'd call it. But I read about Flint."

"Everyone read about Flint."

"Not everyone understood it. I understood enough to know that when a city's water system poisons its own residents and nobody goes to prison, the problem isn't the pipes."

Marcus's expression changed. It was a small change — a tightening around the eyes, a shift in the angle of his head — but Cassiel, who had spent two centuries reading the micro-expressions of people in crisis, registered it as the first sign of genuine engagement. Not with her. With his own anger, which had been buried under exhaustion and grief and the professional habit of presenting scientific problems in scientific language, which had the unintended effect of stripping them of the moral urgency that had driven him into the work in the first place.

"The problem is never the pipes," he said.

"What is the problem?"

"It's — " He hesitated. This was the moment where people usually deflected, where the scale of the answer overwhelmed the capacity to articulate it and the speaker retreated to safe generalities. Cassiel waited. She had learned, in two hundred years, that the most important skill in these conversations was not speaking. It was the quality of the silence you offered. A silence that expected an answer. A silence that had space in it.

"The problem is that clean water is a market failure," Marcus said. "The people who need it the most can't pay for it. The people who can pay for it already have it. And the technology to bridge that gap exists — or could exist, the research is there, the materials science is there — but there's no economic incentive to develop it. Defense contracts pay. Water filtration for rural Bangladesh doesn't."

"Nobody's funding it."

"Nobody's funding it." He said it flatly, the way you state a physical constant. "I've applied to the NSF three times. Rejected three times. My advisor — he died. Last month. He was the PI on the grant. Without him, the department doesn't see a reason to continue."

"What do they see?"

"They see a fourth-year graduate student without a publication record and without an advisor and without funding, working on technology that has no commercial application in the U.S. market. They see a lab they can reassign. They see a problem."

"What do you see?"

Marcus was quiet for a moment. The coffee shop filled the silence — the espresso machine, a murmured conversation at the next table, the muted trumpet finding its way through a bridge.

"I see seven hundred people outside Jessore drinking arsenic every morning," he said. "I see a girl — there's a photo in my advisor's office, or there was — eleven years old, her name is Nasreen, and her hands are covered in keratoses. That's arsenicosis. Dark patches, thickened skin. It's the first visible symptom. After that comes vascular disease, neurological damage, cancer. She's eleven. She drinks from the same well her mother drinks from and her grandmother drank from, and the well was supposed to be the solution — it was drilled to avoid surface water contamination — and instead it's pulling up arsenic from the bedrock."

He stopped. He looked at his coffee. "It doesn't matter," he said. "Nobody's funding this. Nobody cares about clean water in Bangladesh when there's money in defense contracts."

Cassiel let the statement hang. She let it occupy the space between them, let it exist in the air of the coffee shop with its jazz and its mediocre art and its wobbling tables, and then she said the thing she had come here to say — not because she had rehearsed it, though she had, but because it was true, and because the truth of it was the one thing she could offer that the Subtlety Protocols could not prohibit.

"The people drinking arsenic-laced water care."

Marcus looked at her.

"Nasreen cares," Cassiel said. "Her mother cares. The seven hundred people in Jessore care. They just can't fund your grant."

She did not elaborate. She did not give a speech about the moral imperative of scientific research or the obligations of privilege or the cosmic significance of individual choices. She said six words, and then she drank her coffee, and the six words sat between them on the table like a document that had not been signed.

Marcus said nothing for a long time.

Then he said, "I had a colleague. Years ago. A materials scientist. She was working on membrane technology from a different angle — polymer blends, not nanoparticle embedding. We met at a talk in 2017. Talked for four hours about nanofiltration." A pause. "I haven't spoken to her in seven years."

"Why not?"

"I don't know. Life. Focus. My advisor was enough — we had what we needed in the lab. I didn't think I needed anyone else." He looked at his laptop. The Langmuir curves were still on the screen, patiently describing the mathematics of how molecules attach to surfaces, how bonds form and saturate and reach equilibrium. "Maybe I did."

Cassiel nodded. She finished her coffee. She stood up.

"Good luck with the membrane," she said.

"Thanks. I — thanks." He paused. "I didn't get your name."

"Cass," she said, which was true enough.

"Marcus."

"Good luck, Marcus."

She left him there, at the table near the back wall, with his laptop open and his coffee cooling and something in his expression that had not been there when he walked in — not hope, exactly, not anything so legible as hope, but a hairline fracture in the resignation, a seam where the light could enter if the light chose to.

---

Outside, the morning was still beautiful in the excessive way that September mornings in Philadelphia can be, the sunlight too warm and too generous, the sky offensively blue. Cassiel walked half a block, turned a corner, and sat down on a bench outside a dry cleaner that didn't open until ten.

She pulled out her phone. It was a three-year-old Samsung with a cracked screen protector and a case that had once been dark blue and was now the color of a bruise. Angels used phones. They used phones the way they used everything else in the terrestrial operating environment — transit cards, debit accounts, lease agreements, health insurance (not that they could die, but try renting an apartment without it) — with the grim practicality of immigrants navigating a system designed for someone else. Cassiel's phone contained the tools of her work: encrypted messaging with other field angels, a calendar that tracked case windows and intervention deadlines, a notes app filled with observations in a shorthand that no one else could read, and a reporting interface that connected to Gabriel's — now Azrael's — administrative system in the 3rd Heaven.

She opened the reporting interface and began typing.

> **MARGIN CASE MC-2024-7.4 — CHEN, Marcus D.**
> **Classification:** Cascade-7, Position 4 of 7
> **Status:** Active — First Contact Completed
>
> **Date of Contact:** September 19, 2024
> **Location:** Linnea's Coffee, 4712 Baltimore Ave, Philadelphia
> **Duration:** Approximately 22 minutes
> **Cover:** Casual encounter. Subject initiated no inquiry into operative's background beyond stated cover (consulting, science-adjacent). Cover held.
>
> **Assessment:**
> Subject is in acute margin state. Three concurrent destabilizers — grant failure (third rejection, NSF), death of primary mentor (Dr. R. Whitfield, aortic dissection, August 2024), dissolution of romantic partnership — have converged with pre-existing financial stress (student debt: $43K, familial medical needs) to produce a decision point between abandoning primary research (nano-filtration, arsenic removal) for commercial employment and continuing research without institutional support.
>
> Subject was non-responsive to initial contact. Responded to technical engagement re: his research methodology. Became animated when describing the problem his work addresses (arsenic contamination, Jessore district, Bangladesh). Emotional engagement increased when specific human impact was referenced.
>
> **Intervention Notes:**
> Primary technique: mirroring. Subject articulated his own reasons for continuing the work when given a receptive, technically literate audience. Operative did not direct, persuade, or introduce new information. Operative reflected subject's existing knowledge and values back to him in a social context where they could be heard.
>
> Key moment: Subject stated "Nobody cares about clean water in Bangladesh." Operative responded: "The people drinking arsenic-laced water care." Subject fell silent. Subsequent behavior indicated re-engagement with purpose orientation.
>
> Subject referenced former colleague (Amira Hassan, materials science, last contact 2017). This reference was unprompted. If subject re-establishes contact with Hassan, probability of research continuation increases significantly (see Cascade-7 projections, Appendix C.4, connection node 7.4-7.4a).
>
> **Prognosis:**
> Subject re-engaged with primary purpose. Confidence level: MODERATE. This case is not resolved. Subject has not signed the competing employment offer but has also not taken concrete steps to continue research. The margin remains open. Recommend continued observation at reduced proximity. Next contact window: TBD pending subject's actions re: Hassan.
>
> **Compliance Note:**
> All actions within Subtlety Protocol parameters. No information disclosed that could not be attributed to natural encounter. No anomalous causation.

She saved the report. She looked at her phone's home screen. Three notifications waited.

The first was from Raphael, who communicated almost exclusively in text messages that read like the work of someone who had learned English from podcasts and memes: *elena case update: collector bought 3 pieces. she cried. good tears. margin holding. how's your tuesday*

It was Thursday. Raphael's relationship to the calendar was approximate.

The second was from the system — an automated alert, the kind that appeared when a Cascade case shifted status. CASE MC-2024-7.2 — WILLIAMS, Keisha (DeShawn). STATUS CHANGE: ESCALATION. She opened it. DeShawn Williams, Keisha's seventeen-year-old son, had been seen at an address flagged as a recruitment location for the Eastside crew. Michael was on it — Michael, who had been working gang cases in the inner cities since before Cassiel was born, who moved through that world with the battle-worn patience of a general who understood that the enemy was not the boys with guns but the systems that put guns in their hands. Michael had it. She told herself Michael had it.

The third notification was from a number she didn't recognize, which meant it was from the administrative system routing through a new node, which meant Azrael, who had inherited Gabriel's infrastructure and was still figuring out how the wiring worked. The message was brief: *C-7 status meeting tonight. All case leads. My office. 9pm. Don't be late. — A.*

Gabriel would have added something personal. A question about how she was holding up. A joke, probably bad. Gabriel had been many things — overworked, principled, doomed — but he had never been impersonal, and his absence was a specific shape that Cassiel carried the way you carry a bruise, aware of it only when something pressed against it.

She put the phone away. She sat on the bench outside the dry cleaner and watched the street.

A woman pushed a stroller past, the baby asleep, the woman's face slack with the particular exhaustion of new parenthood. A man in a hard hat crossed the intersection, lunch pail in hand. A girl — eleven, maybe twelve — walked by with a backpack and earbuds and the studied indifference of someone practicing being a teenager.

Cassiel watched them. She watched them the way she had watched humans for two hundred and twelve years, which was not the way a scientist watches subjects or a surveillance camera watches a corridor but the way a person who has been alive for a very long time watches the living — with attention and fatigue and a tenderness that was, she suspected, closer to grief than to love, though the difference between the two had become, over the centuries, increasingly academic.

She had had this conversation before. Not with Marcus — with all of them. The thousands of conversations in coffee shops and bus stops and hospital waiting rooms and courthouse hallways and grocery store parking lots that were the substance of her work, each one unique in its details and identical in its architecture: a person on the edge, a question asked at the right moment, a silence held long enough for the person to hear their own voice saying the thing they already knew. She had done it in 1847, in a tenement on the Lower East Side, with a woman deciding whether to report her husband to the police. She had done it in 1923, in a speakeasy in Harlem, with a musician deciding whether to destroy the only copy of a composition that would, forty years later, be recognized as a masterwork. She had done it in 1968, on a bridge in Memphis, with a man who was not Martin Luther King Jr. but who knew him, and who was deciding whether to continue the work after the assassination or retreat into grief and safety.

None of them remembered her. They remembered the conversation — or they remembered the feeling of the conversation, the sensation of having thought something through in the presence of another human being and arrived at a conclusion that felt, in the moment, like their own. Which it was. That was the point. The Subtlety Protocols were not about deception. They were about midwifery. You did not create the decision. You created the conditions in which the decision could be born.

But the midwife went home alone. The midwife sat on a bench outside a dry cleaner and felt the weight of all the births she had attended and knew that each one of them — every man and woman and teenager she had sat across from in two hundred years of coffee shops and bus stops — had gone on to live their lives without knowing she existed, and that this was correct, this was the design, this was the work as it was meant to be done, and that it was also, in a way she had never been able to resolve, lonely in a manner that she suspected was not just occupational but ontological. The loneliness of the angel of solitude and tears, doing her Saturn's-day work in a world that ran on human connection and in which she was, by design and by disposition, perpetually adjacent but never joined.

Six more cases. Marcus was the fourth, and his margin was holding, and the conversation had gone as well as a first contact could go, and none of it felt like enough.

It never felt like enough.

Cassiel stood up. She put her hands in her pockets. She walked toward the subway, because there was a status meeting at nine, and because Keisha's son was at a recruitment house, and because Elena's studio fire had created a window that Raphael was monitoring, and because the school shooting that Sariel had been assigned to prevent was four weeks away and the indicators were accelerating, and because the system demanded that she be everywhere and feel nothing and trust that the pattern held, even when the pattern included children drinking arsenic and mothers who couldn't afford hip replacements and young men who went to prison for years that they would never get back.

She descended into the station. The platform smelled like heated metal and urine and something sweet — a pretzel cart, maybe, or the ghost of one. A train was coming. She could hear it in the tunnel, the sound building from a vibration in the rails to a roar that filled the underground space and then resolved into a machine, silver and scarred, that opened its doors and let people out and let people in with the democratic indifference of public transit.

Cassiel got on. She held the overhead bar and swayed with the motion and thought about Marcus Chen sitting in a coffee shop with his laptop open, not typing, and she thought about Nasreen in Jessore with arsenic keratoses on her eleven-year-old hands, and she thought about a membrane that cost eleven cents and could filter fifty liters a day, and she thought about the distance between what existed and what was possible, and the train carried her north.

<!-- AGENT:NOTE — Cassiel's report establishes MC-2024 case status: first contact complete, margin holding, not resolved. Her internal reflection mirrors the Ch. 1 waiting room — same exhaustion, same doubt, same continuation. Six other Cascade-7 cases are in motion: Keisha/DeShawn (escalating), Elena (Raphael handling), school shooting (Sariel, 4 weeks out), others referenced. Marcus's next action (contacting Amira Hassan) will determine whether Ch. 22's breakthrough occurs. Continuity: Gabriel is dead (Ch. 25 in future), Azrael has taken over administration. -->
