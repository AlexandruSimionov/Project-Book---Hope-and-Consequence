# Chapter 19: Try Once More (Reprise)

**Queens, New York — April 2020**

---

The coffee had gone cold an hour ago, but Sarah Morrison drank it anyway.

She stood at the nurses' station on the seventh floor, one hip against the counter, and the déjà vu was so precise it bordered on hallucination — the posture, the cold coffee, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead with the same jaundiced persistence they'd had in 1985, as if the hospital had been built around that frequency and everything else — the staff, the patients, the decades — had simply moved through it. She was sixty-three years old. She was Chief of Medicine. She had been standing at nurses' stations in this hospital for thirty-five years, and the coffee was always cold, and the lights always buzzed, and the only things that changed were the faces and the names and the particular way the world had decided to break that week.

This week, the world had decided to break completely.

The seventh floor had been converted to a COVID ward six days ago. Before that, it had been medical-surgical — the floor where patients went after procedures, where they recovered or didn't, where the work was steady and unglamorous and governed by routines that Sarah could have performed with her eyes shut. The conversion had taken forty-eight hours. They'd sealed the stairwells with plastic sheeting. They'd moved the supply carts and replaced them with PPE stations — boxes of N95 masks, face shields with elastic bands that left red welts across the forehead, yellow gowns that rustled when you walked and smelled of the particular chemical that industrial laundering never quite removed. They'd set up negative-pressure rooms in the two isolation suites and then, when the isolation suites filled on the first day, they'd converted the conference room and the break room and the storage closet where Sarah had once gone to cry after losing a patient in 1991, a private space she'd kept in her mental map of the hospital like a room in a house she could always go back to. That room was now full of ventilators.

She drank the cold coffee. It tasted like nothing — not bad, not burnt, simply absent of flavor, as if the beans had given up. She had stopped tasting things around hour forty. This was her third consecutive shift, though the word "shift" had lost its meaning in the way that all temporal divisions had lost their meaning in the past week. Shifts implied endings. Shifts implied that someone would come to relieve you, that the work would be handed off, that you would walk out the door and go home and sleep and eat and return. The residents were breaking. The nurses were breaking. Two had quit yesterday — not dramatically, not with speeches or confrontations, but quietly, the way people quit when the alternative is something worse. They had simply not returned for their shifts, and their absences had been absorbed the way all absences were absorbed now, by the people who remained.

The supply closet — the real one, the one with gauze and saline and the medications that kept the machines going — was nearly empty. Sarah had conducted an inventory that morning with the head pharmacist, a man named Greenbaum who had been at St. Michael's for twenty-two years and who had stood in the supply closet with his clipboard and looked at the shelves with the expression of someone surveying the remains of a house after a fire: assessing, methodical, and privately devastated. They had five days of sedatives at current usage. Three days of paralytics. The ventilator tubing needed to be replaced every seventy-two hours per protocol, and they had enough tubing for twelve days, and they had nineteen patients on ventilators, and the math was the kind of math that did not require a calculator to understand.

Sarah drank the coffee. She set the cup in the sink at the nurses' station, next to three other cups that had been abandoned there by people who had moved on to the next crisis before they could clean up after the last one. The sink was full. Everything was full. The ward, the ICU, the hallways where they'd placed overflow beds because there was nowhere else to put them, the parking lot outside where the refrigerated trucks hummed — everything in the hospital was full of the thing it was not designed to hold.

---

The residents gathered at six a.m. for rounds. Sarah had eight of them — five third-years, two second-years, and a fourth-year fellow named James Park who had been on the COVID ward since day one and who carried himself with the particular calm of someone who had decided, at some point in the past six days, that panic was simply not available to him. James was thirty-one. He was slight, precise in his movements, with the kind of face that patients trusted instinctively — angular and serious, but with a quality of attention that made people feel seen. He wore his N95 with the straps crossed at the back, a technique he'd developed because the standard configuration pressed against a scar behind his left ear, and the crossing of the straps had become, in the strange shorthand of the ward, a recognizable signature. You saw the crossed straps and you knew it was James.

Sarah stood at the whiteboard. She had written the patient list by hand, because the electronic system had crashed twice this week, because the IT department was overwhelmed, because everything was overwhelmed. Twenty-three patients. Nineteen on ventilators. The whiteboard was a grid of names and numbers — oxygen saturation, ventilator settings, medication schedules, prognosis codes that Sarah had devised herself because the existing codes didn't account for the particular calculus of pandemic triage, the daily renegotiation of who got what and for how long.

"We have two ventilators available," Sarah said. "As of this morning. Two. There are four patients in the ER who need them."

The residents looked at the whiteboard. The math, again, was clear.

"Mrs. Delgado in room three is declining," said Lauren, a third-year with dark circles so deep they looked structural, permanent features of a face that had been reconfigured by exhaustion. "Sats dropped to eighty-one overnight. I increased the FiO2 but she's not responding. She's been on the vent for eleven days."

"Mr. Hassan in seven is improving," James said. "Sats up to ninety-four on forty percent. He could potentially come off in the next twenty-four hours, which would free a vent."

"Potentially," Lauren said.

"He's trending in the right direction."

Sarah wrote the numbers on the board. She wrote them because writing gave her hands something to do, and because the numbers, for all their cruelty, were at least concrete — they could be measured and compared and arranged into hierarchies that, if not fair, were at least transparent. The alternative was feeling, and feeling was a resource she could not afford. Not at hour forty. Not with twenty-three patients and two ventilators and four more people downstairs who were drowning in their own fluid.

"I want to talk about the triage protocol," Sarah said. She said it the way she said everything now — levelly, without inflection, the voice of a woman who had learned long ago that the way you said a thing in a crisis mattered as much as the thing itself. "We've been making these decisions on the fly. I want us to make them deliberately. What are our criteria?"

They went through it. Age. Comorbidities. Likelihood of recovery. Time on the ventilator. Sarah let them talk. She let them argue. She let James advocate for the patient in room seven and Lauren argue that the ER patients had been waiting too long and a second-year named Patel suggest a rotation system that was logistically impossible but ethically sound, and she let them arrive, together, at the consensus that there was no consensus, that the math of triage was not mathematics but philosophy, and that philosophy did not produce answers so much as it produced better questions.

Then she told them about Rosa Chen.

She hadn't planned to. The story came the way it always came — not summoned but triggered, called up by the particular configuration of exhaustion and fluorescent light and the faces of young doctors who were learning, in real time, that medicine was not a science of saving but a practice of choosing. She told them about 1985. About the three a.m. code. About the eighteen minutes and the nurses' looks and the moment when she had opened her mouth to call time of death and something — she did not say what, she never said what, because she had spent thirty-five years not knowing what — had intervened.

"I was twenty-eight," she said. "Third-year resident. The attending had gone home. I was alone with a seventy-one-year-old woman whose heart had been fibrillating for eighteen minutes, and every person in that room was ready to stop, and I was ready to stop, and I tried one more time."

The residents listened. They had heard versions of this story — Sarah told it to every cohort, the way a priest reads the same scripture, not for the information but for the ritual, the reminder. But this time the story landed differently. This time the hallway behind them was full of patients and the supply closet was nearly empty and the math of the day was already impossible, and the story of one more try was not an abstraction but a dare.

"She lived," Sarah said. "Rosa Chen. Age seventy-one. Eighteen minutes of v-fib, nineteen shocks, and she converted to sinus on the last one. She lived for six more months. She went home to her daughter. She held her daughter's hand and told her the angels would help."

Sarah paused. She was not sentimental about the story — she had told it too many times for sentiment, had stripped it down to its components the way a mechanic strips an engine, keeping only the parts that worked. But the stripped-down version still had an edge. It still cut.

"You never know what a life might do," she said. "That's the thing I want you to carry. Not optimism — optimism is a feeling, and feelings don't survive this. Carry the uncertainty. Carry the not-knowing. When you're standing at a bed and the math says stop, remember that the math doesn't know what happens after. The math doesn't know who goes home and what they say and who hears it and what it makes them do. You don't either. None of us do. So when you can, when there's anything left to try — try once more."

James looked at her. His eyes above the crossed-strap mask were dark and steady and held something she recognized, because she had seen it in her own face thirty-five years ago: the expression of a person who had just been given a frame for something they already felt.

---

The patient arrived at 2:47 p.m.

Margaret Calloway. Seventy-two years old. COVID pneumonia, nine days of symptoms, oxygen saturation dropping. Her daughter had driven her from a house in Ozone Park after Margaret's home pulse oximeter — a device she'd ordered from Amazon three weeks ago, when the news began to sound like the news from another country and she'd decided, with the practical stubbornness of a woman who had raised four children and buried a husband and survived a house fire in 1987, to be prepared — read seventy-nine percent. The daughter had left Margaret at the ER entrance because visitors were not allowed, had watched through the glass doors as her mother was taken inside, and had driven home to wait.

Sarah saw the chart at three-fifteen. Age: 72. Comorbidities: hypertension, controlled; type 2 diabetes, managed; prior history of pneumonia, 2016. Current presentation: bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest X-ray, oxygen saturation 76 percent on fifteen liters, respiratory rate 34, declining. The team had intubated her in the ER. She was on the ventilator now. She was on the ventilator because there had been one available — Mr. Hassan in room seven had come off his that morning, as James had predicted, and the freed vent had gone to Margaret Calloway, and the timing was the timing, the kind of thing that in any other context would be called luck and in a pandemic was called the daily lottery of resource allocation.

By four o'clock, she was coding.

The alarm sounded at the nurses' station. Sarah was already moving — not toward Margaret's room but toward the sound, the way she always moved toward the sound, the Pavlovian response of a career spent answering alarms. She pulled on gloves in the hallway. She pushed into the room. Margaret Calloway was on the bed, small in the way that certain patients were small, dwarfed by the ventilator and the IV poles and the monitor and the sheer institutional weight of the machinery around her, and her heart was in v-fib, and the monitor showed the same trembling, purposeless rhythm that Sarah had seen a thousand times, the same rhythm Rosa Chen's heart had shown in 1985 in a room three floors below this one.

James was already there. He had started compressions. His hands were stacked on Margaret's sternum, and his body moved with the controlled, rhythmic force of someone who had been trained well and had practiced on mannequins and had done this on real patients and still, each time, brought to it the full weight of his attention, as if the act of pressing on a stranger's chest were not routine but singular, each compression an argument for continuity.

"V-fib," said the nurse. "Three minutes."

"Charge to two hundred," James said.

The defibrillator whined. The sound was the same as it had always been — high, dental, a frequency that lived in the space behind Sarah's eyes. She stood in the doorway. She did not take over. James was running the code, and he was running it well, and the role of the attending in a code run by a competent fellow was to watch and intervene only when intervention was necessary.

"Charged."

"Clear."

The shock. The body's jump. The monitor: artifact, then fibrillation. Nothing.

"Resume. Epi, one milligram."

The drug went in. Compressions continued. The monitor did not change.

"Six minutes," the nurse said.

James shocked again. Nothing. Again. Nothing. The fibrillation continued, the heart shaking instead of pumping, a muscle that had lost the ability to organize itself. Sarah watched from the doorway. She watched James's hands on the chest and the nurse's hands on the syringe and the monitor's green line quivering with the same useless energy, and she thought about the whiteboard upstairs and the two ventilators and the four patients in the ER and the math that said: *This patient is seventy-two years old with three comorbidities and a heart that has been fibrillating for six minutes and there is a forty-one-year-old downstairs who needs this ventilator.*

"Ten minutes," the nurse said. Her voice was neutral. The neutrality was professional, practiced, the same flat tone Denise had used in 1985. *Eighteen minutes is a long time.* Different nurse, different decade, same voice, same subtext.

James looked at Sarah.

She knew what he was seeing. An attending in the doorway, the Chief of Medicine, sixty-three years old, with the authority to call it. He was looking for permission — not to stop, but to be told to stop, because stopping on your own was a different thing than being told, and the difference mattered at three in the morning and at three in the afternoon and at every hour in between.

"Twelve minutes," the nurse said. "Doctor?"

James looked at the monitor. He looked at Margaret Calloway, at her face, which was slack and gray and revealed nothing about who she was or who she had been or what she might yet be. He looked at the nurse. He looked at Sarah.

"One more round," James said. "Charge to three-sixty. Push another epi."

The nurse looked at Sarah. The look was the same look — thirty-five years later, different eyes, same question. *Is this the young doctor who doesn't know when to stop?*

Sarah said nothing. She did not nod. She did not intervene. She stood in the doorway and let James make the call, because the call was his to make, because this was the moment she had been preparing him for without knowing she was preparing him for it, because the story of Rosa Chen was not a story about Sarah — it was a story about the next person who heard it, and the person after that, and the person after that, an inheritance passed down not through blood but through the act of standing in a room where someone was dying and choosing, against the math, to try once more.

"Epi's in."

"Charged."

"Clear."

The shock. The body. The monitor.

Artifact. Then —

A line. Not fibrillation. Not asystole. A rhythm. Tentative, irregular, feeling its way — the same uncertain, groping quality of Rosa Chen's heart restarting in 1985, as if the organ were waking from a deep sleep and was not yet sure of the room it had woken into.

"Sinus," the nurse said. Her voice had changed. "Rate of — forty-eight. Fifty. Fifty-two."

James took his hands off Margaret Calloway's chest. He stepped back. His arms were shaking. Above the mask, his eyes were wet, and he blinked and the moisture tracked down the bridge of his nose and disappeared into the fabric.

"Blood pressure?"

"Seventy-six over forty. Coming up. Eighty over forty-four."

"Sats?"

"Eighty-five. Eighty-seven. Climbing."

Sarah watched from the doorway. She watched the numbers climb the way she had watched them climb in 1985, with the same total attention, the same suspended breath, the same inability to name the thing she was feeling because the thing she was feeling did not have a name — it was too large for gratitude and too small for faith and too complicated for relief, a compound emotion that existed only in this room, in this moment, in the particular intersection of a life almost lost and a life given back.

Margaret Calloway's chest rose and fell. The ventilator hissed. The monitor beeped — not the frantic, purposeless beeping of fibrillation but the steady, metered beeping of a heart that had remembered what it was for.

"Nice work," Sarah said to James. Her voice was not steady. She did not try to make it steady.

James nodded. He pulled off his gloves. His hands were trembling in the way that Sarah's hands had trembled in 1985, and he did not make fists to stop it. He let them shake.

---

She went home that night. Home for the first time in four days — four days of sleeping in the on-call room, of eating granola bars from the vending machine, of washing her face in the bathroom sink and looking at herself in the mirror and recognizing the woman she saw the way you recognize a building you haven't visited in years: the structure familiar, the details changed.

Her apartment was in Sunnyside, a two-bedroom she'd lived in for nineteen years, since the divorce, since the children had grown and gone and the house in Forest Hills had become too large for one person and too full of the sounds that one person couldn't make. She unlocked the door and stood in the hallway and smelled the apartment's particular smell — old books, radiator heat, the faint ghost of the turmeric she'd used three weeks ago in a recipe she'd been too tired to finish.

She sat in the dark kitchen. She did not turn on the lights. The window above the sink showed the brick wall of the next building, close enough to touch, and between the buildings a narrow channel of sky that was, at this hour, a deep, impenetrable black. No stars. The city's light pollution erased them. Sarah had not seen stars since a trip to Vermont in 2017, three years ago, a weekend with her daughter and her daughter's husband and the grandchildren, and they had stood in a field behind the rented cabin and looked up and Sarah had thought: *There they are. They were always there.*

Her hands were on the table. They shook. They had been shaking for days — not the fine tremor of caffeine or fatigue but a deeper vibration, structural, as if the bones themselves were uncertain of their alignment. She looked at them. Sixty-three years old. These hands had held Rosa Chen's defibrillator paddles in 1985. Had held her children as infants. Had held the hands of dying patients and the pens that signed death certificates and the coffee cups that bridged the distance between one loss and the next. They were mottled now, the veins standing out, the skin thinner than it had been — not old, exactly, but used, the way a tool is used, worn by the work it was made for.

She sat in the dark and wondered if it was enough. If any of it was enough. If the thirty-five years of trying once more, of telling the story, of standing in rooms where the math said stop and choosing not to — if all of it added up to something, or if it was simply the thing she did, the way a river runs, not because it has a destination but because running is what rivers do.

Margaret Calloway was alive. James Park had saved her. James had saved her because Sarah had told him about Rosa Chen, and Sarah had tried once more on Rosa Chen because something had whispered to her in a room at three in the morning thirty-five years ago, and the chain ran backward through time and forward through people and Sarah could not see it — could not see that Margaret Calloway had four children, the youngest twelve, a boy who attended a high school in Ozone Park where the guidance counselors had been cut two years ago, a boy who was angry and alone and moving toward something terrible, and that Margaret would survive this night and this disease and would, in two years, have another child, a daughter, and that the daughter would grow up and find her way to a nonprofit in Brooklyn run by a woman named Keisha Williams, and that the daughter's presence there would matter in ways that no math could predict.

Sarah did not see the chain. She did not see the man in the hallway outside the seventh-floor supply closet — a man she would not have recognized, thin, serious-faced, who had been standing in the hospital for hours, watching the doctors and nurses cycle through their shifts with the focused attention of someone conducting an audit. He had been there all week. He was working cases of his own — healthcare workers on the edge, residents considering quitting, nurses who had stopped sleeping, an orderly who had started drinking. He was the Angel of Education and Youth, and his name was Sariel, and he had been in service long enough to recognize a pattern when he saw one.

He had watched Sarah tell the story of Rosa Chen to her residents that morning. He had stood in the hallway, just outside the doorway, and listened. He had heard the words *try once more* and had filed them — not because he understood their significance, not because he could see the chain of consequence that extended from them, but because the words had weight, the kind of weight that accumulates when a phrase is repeated across decades and bodies and rooms, and Sariel had learned, in his years of service, to pay attention to weight.

He filed it. He moved on. He had seventeen cases of his own, and the day was not done, and the pattern — if it was a pattern, if the words and the choices and the lives they touched were anything more than accident — would reveal itself in time, or it would not, and either way the work continued.

Sarah sat in her dark kitchen. The window showed the brick wall and the narrow stripe of black sky. Her hands shook on the table. She was sixty-three years old, and she was tired in a way that sleep would not fix, tired in the bones, in the architecture, in the place where the body meets the will and the will says *keep going* and the body asks *why* and the answer is not a word but a feeling — the feeling of a heart restarting on a monitor, the feeling of numbers climbing, the feeling of someone alive who was not alive a moment ago, and the not-knowing, the permanent not-knowing, of what that life might do.

She sat in the dark. She did not know if it was enough. She suspected it wasn't. She would go back tomorrow and do it again anyway.

She sat there for a long time. The apartment was quiet. The city, outside, was quiet in the way it had been quiet for weeks — not silent, because New York was never silent, but muted, the volume turned down, the usual roar reduced to sirens and wind and the distant sound of the 7 train running its route through a city that had forgotten what normal was. Sarah listened to the quiet. She finished the cold coffee from the thermos she'd carried home. She set it on the table.

Tomorrow she would go back. She would stand at the whiteboard and write the names and the numbers and make the choices that no one should have to make and that someone had to make, and she would tell the story again if it needed telling, and she would let James tell it too, because the story was not hers anymore — it belonged to everyone who had heard it and carried it and acted on it, an inheritance that grew each time it was given away.

She did not know this was how it worked. She did not know that the sentence she had carried for thirty-five years — *always try once more, you never know what a life might do* — had become a kind of prayer, passed from her lips to the hands of hundreds of doctors who had carried it into their own rooms, their own three a.m. decisions, their own moments of exhaustion and doubt. She did not know about the chain. She did not know about the web. She knew only that a woman named Rosa Chen had lived, and that a woman named Margaret Calloway had lived, and that between those two events there were thirty-five years of trying and failing and trying again, and that the trying was the thing, the only thing, the thing that mattered when nothing else did.

She rinsed the thermos. She set it in the dish rack. She went to bed.

<!-- AGENT:NOTE — This chapter deliberately echoes Chapter 2 in structure, pacing, and specific details: cold coffee, fluorescent lights, the defibrillator's "dental whine," the nurses' lateral glances, the moment of choosing to try once more, the hand tremor. The parallels are structural, not called out — the reader should feel the echo without being told it's an echo. Sarah's POV is locked: she cannot see the significance of Margaret Calloway (school shooter's mother), cannot see Sariel in the hallway, cannot see the chain of consequence. The chapter's final paragraphs mirror Chapter 2's ending (listing what Sarah "did not know") but from a place of accumulated weariness rather than youthful bewilderment. James Park is established as the inheritor of Sarah's philosophy — the chain continues. -->
