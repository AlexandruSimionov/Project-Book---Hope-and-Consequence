# Chapter 12: Orientation

**March 2010 — Dannemora State Correctional Facility, Clinton County, New York**

---

The bus smelled like diesel and unwashed upholstery and the particular sourness of men who had been sitting too long in clothes they hadn't chosen. David Okonkwo pressed his forehead against the window and watched upstate New York slide past in long gray intervals — bare trees, frozen fields, a gas station with a hand-painted sign advertising bait and ammo, the Adirondacks rising in the distance like something out of a textbook he'd never finish reading. His wrists ached where the cuffs bit. The shackles connecting his ankles to the floor bolt allowed about eight inches of movement, enough to shift his weight from one hip to the other, not enough to stand. He had been on the bus for six hours.

There were eleven other men on the bus. David did not look at them. He had learned this already, in the seventy-two days since sentencing — the geometry of not-looking, the way you could inhabit a space with other bodies and keep your eyes on a fixed middle distance that included no one, acknowledged nothing, existed in the narrow corridor between provocation and submission. The man across the aisle had a scar that ran from his left ear to his jaw, a raised pink seam like a zipper track. The man behind David coughed in a wet, repeating cycle that sounded structural, something wrong in the lungs. David looked at the window. He looked at the trees.

Eighteen years old. Fifteen-year sentence. He did the math the way he'd been doing it since the judge's mouth formed the number: he would be thirty-three when he got out. If he got out on time. If he kept clean. If the system that had swallowed him at eighteen decided, at thirty-three, to open its mouth and let him walk back into whatever the world had become by then. Thirty-three was an abstraction. Thirty-three was his mother's age now. He tried to imagine himself at his mother's age and could not. He could not imagine himself at nineteen.

The bus turned off the county road and onto a narrower road, and then onto a road that was not really a road but an approach, flanked by double fencing topped with concertina wire, the coils catching the weak March sun. The facility rose ahead of them — stone walls, watchtowers, the architecture of a building designed not to be left. It looked old. It looked like something built by people who believed that punishment was a physical structure, that you could contain a man's future inside concrete and steel the way you contained water in a tank, by building the walls thick enough. The bus slowed. A gate opened. The gate closed behind them.

David's stomach clenched. Not fear, exactly. Something more primitive than fear — the body's recognition that it was entering a space it could not leave, the animal knowledge of enclosure, cage-logic, the instinct that had been coded into primate nervous systems a hundred thousand years before anyone built a prison. He breathed through it. He had been breathing through things for seventy-two days.

---

Intake took three hours.

They filed off the bus in a line, shuffling in their ankle chains, and were led through a series of doors that opened from one side only, each door heavier than the last, each corridor narrower, each room more stripped of anything that was not function. A holding area with benches bolted to the floor. A processing room where a corrections officer with a clipboard called their names and checked their paperwork and asked questions in a flat voice that treated language as a delivery system for bureaucratic necessity and nothing more. Name. Date of birth. Prior incarcerations. Medical conditions. Allergies. Emergency contact.

"Okonkwo, David. March second, nineteen ninety-two."

"First incarceration?"

"Yes."

The CO looked at him. It was a brief look, not unfriendly, not friendly — an assessment, the way a mechanic looks at a car that has just come in, reading the year and the mileage and the condition of the body in a single practiced glance. David was six feet tall, thin in the way of eighteen-year-olds who had grown up too fast and hadn't filled out yet, with a face that still held the geometry of adolescence — wide eyes, skin stretched over cheekbones that hadn't settled into their adult configuration. He looked young. He looked young because he was young, and the CO noted this the way he noted everything, with the flat professional attention of a man who had processed two thousand men through this room and had learned to see each one as a set of variables: age, size, temperament, threat level, likelihood of surviving the first six months.

"Any gang affiliations?"

"No."

"You sure about that?"

"I'm sure."

The CO wrote something on the clipboard and moved on.

The strip search was next. David had been told about this — by his lawyer, by the older men in county, by the system's own grim grapevine of advance intelligence — but the telling had not prepared him for the specific quality of the experience, the way it converted a person into a procedure. He stood in a room with white tiles and a drain in the floor and removed his clothes one item at a time, handing each piece to a guard who placed it in a clear plastic bag with a label. He stood naked under a fluorescent tube that hummed at the same frequency as the tube in the courtroom had hummed, and the guard said, "Turn around. Bend over. Spread your cheeks. Cough." And David did these things because there was no choice that resembled not doing them, because refusal was not a category that existed in this room, and the guard examined him with the disinterested efficiency of someone performing a task that had long ago stopped being anything other than a task.

He was given a uniform. The fabric was a cotton-polyester blend the color of dishwater, stiff with the chemical residue of industrial laundering, and it smelled like bleach and something underneath the bleach, something human and persistent that the bleach could not reach. The pants were too long. The shirt was too wide. The boots were wrong for his feet, the left one slightly larger than the right, and he laced them up anyway and stood in them and felt the particular estrangement of wearing clothes that had been chosen for someone his size but not for him, clothes that did not know his body, that carried the memory of other bodies in their seams.

A photograph. A wristband. An ID number that was now, in the system's eyes, more essentially him than his name: 10B-3847. He said the number in his head. He did not like the way it fit there, the way it occupied the same neural space that his name occupied, as if the two were competing for a slot and the number, being newer and louder, was winning.

He was given a bedroll — a thin mattress pad, a sheet, a wool blanket the color of oatmeal — and a clear bag containing a toothbrush, a tube of toothpaste, a comb, and a bar of soap. He carried these things down a corridor and up a flight of stairs and down another corridor, following a guard whose keys jingled with each step, a sound that David would hear in his sleep for the next fifteen years, the particular metallic percussion of someone else's access to the doors.

The cell was seven feet by ten. Two bunks, steel-framed, bolted to the wall. A steel toilet and a steel sink, no partition, no privacy. A shelf. A window — narrow, barred, admitting a rectangle of gray light that fell across the upper bunk like a scar. The walls were painted a green that might once have been meant to be calming and had instead achieved the opposite, a green that existed only in institutions, a color with no equivalent in the natural world, a green that said *you are inside* and nothing else.

The smell hit him as he crossed the threshold. Industrial cleaner — the harsh, pine-scented kind that coated the nostrils and lingered on the tongue — and beneath it, layered like geological strata, the accumulated odor of years of human habitation in a space too small for one body and now holding two: sweat, breath, the chemical tang of the laundry, the faint sourness of a toilet that was four feet from where you slept. The smell of confinement. The smell of time spent in a room that time had stopped visiting.

A man sat on the lower bunk. He was perhaps forty-five, though prison aged people in ways that made estimation unreliable. He had dark skin and a shaved head and the build of someone who had once been larger and had diminished, not from illness but from the slow erosion of years spent in a space that did not require or reward physical size. He was reading a Bible — King James, the spine cracked, the pages soft with use — and he did not look up when David entered.

David stood in the doorway. The guard had gone. The door had not closed — it was open yard time, the cells unlocked until the four o'clock count — but the doorway felt like a threshold in a different sense, a border between the world he had known and the world he was entering, and he stood on it for a moment the way you stand at the edge of cold water, knowing that the entry will be a shock and that postponing it will not make it less of one.

He stepped in. He set the bedroll on the upper bunk. He began to make the bed, because it was something to do with his hands, because his hands were shaking and the shaking was less visible when the hands were occupied.

"Top bunk's yours," the man said, without looking up.

"Yeah," David said. "I figured."

"You figured right." The man turned a page. "Keep your head down, your mouth shut, and don't owe anyone anything."

David waited for more. There was no more. The man read his Bible. David made his bed. The mattress pad was so thin he could feel the steel slats through it, a washboard of ridges that would press into his back all night, every night, for however long they put him in this cell. He tucked the sheet in. He folded the blanket at the foot. He climbed down and stood in the narrow space between the bunks, his arms at his sides, and he listened to the sounds of the prison: the shouts echoing from somewhere below, the clang of a door, the babble of a television tuned to a station nobody was watching, the constant low hum of a building full of men and electricity and metal, a hum that was different from silence the way a fever is different from health — present, all-pervading, a condition rather than a sound.

---

The yard was a rectangle of cracked asphalt enclosed by fencing and overlooked by a guard tower. A basketball hoop stood at one end, its net long gone, the bare rim rusted to the color of dried blood. Groups of men occupied the space according to a geography that David could not yet read but understood instinctively was as rigid as any map — territories defined not by lines but by bodies, by the angle of a shoulder, the direction of a gaze, the particular way a group of men standing together could make the space around them impermeable.

David stood near the wall, in the neutral zone between groups, and he breathed the outdoor air — cold, sharp, carrying the scent of pine from the forests beyond the fencing — and he tried to feel grateful for the air, because gratitude was supposed to help, because his mother had said *find something every day to be grateful for, baby, even if it's just air*, and the air was here, and it was his, at least for the forty-five minutes of yard time.

He saw the man from across the yard before he understood what he was seeing.

The man was leaning against the far fence, alone, his hands in the pockets of his jacket, watching the basketball game that was happening in the center of the yard with the detached attention of someone who had been watching things happen in front of him for a long time and had stopped expecting any of it to include him. He was late twenties, maybe thirty. He had the look of someone who had been in and out — not the hardened stillness of a lifer, but the weathered, watchful quality of a man who knew the rhythms of this place the way a migrant knows the seasons, by repeated exposure, by the body's reluctant adaptation to a cycle it did not choose.

Something in his posture caught David. Something familiar, though David could not have said what. A tilt of the head. An angle of the shoulders. The particular way he stood at the edge of things, adjacent to the crowd but not of it, a man who had learned to occupy margins.

The man's eyes moved across the yard and found David, and David felt the assessment — quick, practiced, calibrated to the specific social physics of this place. The man held David's gaze for a beat, then looked away. Then looked back.

He pushed off the fence and walked over. His gait was unhurried, a walk that said *I'm not approaching you because I need something; I'm approaching you because I decided to*. He stopped three feet from David and looked at him, and David saw that his eyes held the residue of something that might once have been warmth, or hope, a quality that had been worn down but not entirely erased, the way a word carved into wood can be worn smooth by weather and still, if you knew what you were looking for, be read.

"How old are you?" the man asked.

"Eighteen."

The man was quiet for a moment. "How long?"

"Fifteen years."

"Jesus." It was not a prayer. It was not an expletive. It was the sound a man makes when a number hits him in the ribs.

"Felony murder," David said, because he had learned that the question always came next and it was easier to say it first than to wait.

"You do it?"

"I was there. I didn't pull the trigger."

The man nodded. He nodded the way a doctor nods when you describe a symptom that confirms a diagnosis he already suspected — not with surprise, not with judgment, with recognition. "Who was your prosecutor?"

"Reed. Thomas Reed."

Something moved in the man's face. David could not identify it. It was there and then it was not, a shadow crossing water, too fast to hold.

"I know that name," the man said. Then he shook his head, once, as if clearing it. "Long time ago. Different life."

He did not say more about it. He extended his hand. "Jerome."

David shook it. Jerome's grip was firm and brief, the handshake of a man who had learned to touch as little as possible.

"David."

"David. Okay." Jerome leaned against the wall next to him, and for a while they stood in silence, watching the basketball game, and the silence was not uncomfortable in the way that silence between strangers usually was. It was the silence of two people who understood that words cost something in this place and that spending them without cause was a luxury neither could afford.

"Eighteen," Jerome said again, after a while. He was not looking at David. He was looking at the basketball game, at the men running and shouting and performing the ordinary athletics of competitive bodies, and his face held an expression that David would later identify as the specific pain of seeing yourself in someone else, the empathy that is also a wound, because it requires you to remember what you have lost.

"I was seventeen when I first came in," Jerome said. "Seventeen and stupid. Had a lawyer who fought for me, though. Public defender, young guy, believed in all that rehabilitation shit. Got my sentence cut in half." He paused. "Didn't matter. Came back anyway. Twice now."

He said this without self-pity. He said it the way you'd describe the weather in a place where it rained all the time — not with complaint, but with the flat acceptance of a man who had stopped expecting the weather to change.

"This your third time?" David asked.

"Third time. Six years this round." Jerome rubbed the back of his neck. "Funny thing is, that lawyer — the one who got my sentence cut — I think about him sometimes. Wonder if he knows what happened. If he'd still think it was worth it, the fight he put up for me."

He looked at David then, and David felt the weight of the look, the way Jerome was seeing him not as a stranger but as a version of something Jerome recognized — a boy, too young, too soft, standing at the entrance of a corridor that Jerome had already walked to the end of and back, twice.

"You got someone outside?" Jerome asked.

"My mom."

"She coming to visit?"

"She says she is."

"Make sure she does. That's the thing that keeps you — " He stopped. Started again. "That's the thing."

He didn't finish the sentence. He didn't need to.

---

Across the yard, near the weight benches, a man sat alone on a concrete ledge. He was older than the others around him — mid-forties, maybe more — and he sat with the absolute stillness of a man who had stopped moving toward anything. His hands hung between his knees. His eyes were open but not focused, directed at the asphalt between his feet, and he had the quality of a person who had been slowly leaving his own body for years and was now mostly gone, a occupant who had let the lease lapse, still technically present but no longer maintaining the premises.

David did not notice him. There was no reason to notice him. He was one of hundreds of men in this facility, a background figure, part of the landscape of incarceration, as unremarkable as the cracked asphalt or the rusted basketball rim. He had a name that David would not learn for years, and a son he had not seen since the boy was four, and a woman he had once loved and left and would never stop owing, and none of these facts were visible from across a prison yard on a March afternoon. He was just a man sitting still. The world was full of men sitting still.

<!-- AGENT:NOTE — Keisha's ex-husband/DeShawn's father introduced without name per OVERARCHING_NARRATIVE.md. David and the man do not interact or recognize each other's significance. Dramatic irony: reader knows the connection; characters do not. The man's description mirrors the "given up" quality specified in the brief. -->

---

Dinner was served at five. David sat at the end of a long table and ate what was on the tray — a scoop of something that was identified by a laminated card as Salisbury steak, a mound of instant mashed potatoes with a crater of gravy in the center, green beans that had been cooked until they surrendered, a square of cornbread, a carton of milk. The food was not terrible. It was not good. It existed in a category outside the spectrum of terrible-to-good, a category that David would come to think of as *institutional* — food designed not to nourish or to satisfy but to meet a nutritional requirement at a calculable cost per unit, food that was engineered to keep a body alive without ever making the body glad that it was.

He ate. Around him the cafeteria roared with the sound of three hundred men eating and talking and performing the social negotiations of an evening meal — alliances forming and dissolving, debts acknowledged and deferred, the constant, exhausting theater of survival that played out over plastic trays and steel forks. David kept his eyes on his food. He chewed. He swallowed. He thought about his mother's jollof rice, the way the tomatoes and peppers turned the pot into something that smelled like home distilled to its chemical essence, and the thought arrived with a sharpness that felt physical, a blade laid flat against the inside of his ribs, not cutting but pressing, letting him know it was there.

He carried his tray to the window. He walked back to his cell. The four o'clock count was done; the cells were locked for the evening. His cellmate was on the lower bunk, reading his Bible by the light of the fixture above the sink, and David climbed to the upper bunk and lay on his back and stared at the ceiling, which was concrete, which was gray, which was twelve inches from his face.

Fifteen years. The number occupied the cell the way a third body would have occupied it — pressing in from all sides, taking up the air, making the space smaller than it already was. Fifteen years was five thousand four hundred and seventy-five days. He did not know how he knew this. He had not calculated it. The number had arrived in his head fully formed, the way certain facts arrive when the brain has been turning something over in the dark, and now it sat there, enormous and precise, a monument to the distance between where he was and where he would be when this was over.

He would be thirty-three. His mother would be forty-eight. The neighborhood he had grown up in would be — what? He had heard, in county, about the changes already happening, the old buildings coming down and the new ones going up, the rents rising, the bodegas turning into coffee shops, the slow displacement of everything familiar by everything profitable. He might come home to a place that did not recognize him. He might come home to a place that was not home.

The light in the cell was a combination of the fluorescent fixture above the sink and the gray rectangle of the window, and in this light everything was the same muted non-color, the walls and the bunks and the toilet and the faces of the two men who lived in this box, and David lay on his back and closed his eyes and saw, with the involuntary clarity of memory, a swimming pool.

July. Six years ago. The public pool on Atlantic Avenue, the one with the chain-link fence and the cracked concrete deck and the water that was always too warm and too clouded with chlorine, the pool where every kid in the neighborhood went in the summer because it was free and because there was nowhere else to go. David was twelve. He was tall for his age, skinny, with arms that were too long for his body and a face that people said looked older than it was, a face that would get him into trouble later, the face of a boy who could pass for sixteen and would, eventually, be treated like a man for it.

The boy in the water was small. Eight, maybe. David hadn't known him. Hadn't seen him before. Just a kid at the pool — dark hair, serious eyes, a kid who had been playing at the shallow end and drifted, the way kids drift, the way water moves a body without the body knowing it's been moved, a few feet at a time, until the feet reached for the bottom and the bottom wasn't there.

The lifeguard was at the far end, talking to someone. The boy's arms went up. His head went under. He came back up. His mouth opened and no sound came out, because drowning was not what the movies showed, not the splashing and the screaming — it was quiet, a private transaction between a body and the water, and the body was losing.

David saw it. He did not decide to act. That was the thing he would think about later, the thing he could never explain to the lawyers or the judge or the man across the courtroom who had wanted him sentenced to twenty years and had settled, magnanimously, for fifteen. He did not decide. His body moved. His legs kicked off the edge and his arms reached into the water and he grabbed the boy under the arms and pulled, and the boy came up coughing, gasping, his fingers clenched on David's forearm with a grip that left bruises, and David hauled him to the wall and held him there while the boy coughed and breathed and coughed and breathed, and the lifeguard finally turned around and blew his whistle and came running, and by then it was over.

The boy's mother had come. She had held her son and cried and then held David and cried harder, and she had said something to him — David could not remember the exact words, not anymore, something about angels, something about her own mother and a promise — and David had stood there, twelve years old, dripping wet, with the boy's grip-bruises already darkening on his forearm, and he had felt something that he did not have a word for and still did not. A warmth. A rightness. The feeling of having done the thing your body knew to do before your mind caught up to it.

That instinct. That specific, unreasoning impulse to move toward someone who was going under. That was what had brought him here.

Because Terrell had been going under. Terrell, his friend since fifth grade, who had been moving weight for Darius Clayton since he was fifteen and was in too deep and couldn't find the bottom and was drowning in a different kind of water, and he had called David and said *just come with me, just be there, I need someone there, I'm not going to do anything stupid, I just need you there*, and David had gone because he could not not go, because the instinct that had pulled the boy from the pool was the same instinct that pulled him into Terrell's car on a Thursday night in October, the instinct to not leave someone alone in the water.

The robbery had been Terrell's idea. The gun had been Darius's. The convenience store clerk had been sixty-one years old, a Korean man named Mr. Park who had run the store for thirty years and kept a .38 under the counter, and when Darius pointed the 9mm Mr. Park had reached for the .38 and Darius had fired and Mr. Park had fired and Darius had been hit in the shoulder and Mr. Park had been hit in the chest and David had been standing by the door, not holding a weapon, not moving, not doing anything except being there, which was all the law required.

Felony murder. If a death occurs during the commission of a felony, all participants are equally liable, regardless of who pulled the trigger. The prosecutor — a man named Thomas Reed, forty years old, a rising star in the DA's office, a man who had once been a public defender and had once believed in rehabilitation and had once fought to reduce the sentence of a seventeen-year-old named Jerome — this same Thomas Reed had stood in a courtroom and argued that David Okonkwo, eighteen, no prior record, should be sentenced to the maximum under the guidelines, because the city needed to send a message, because the election was in November, because David's face looked older than it was and could be presented to a jury as the face of a man who knew what he was doing.

David did not know what he was doing. He had not known what he was doing when he got in the car. He had not known what he was doing when he stood by the door. He had known only that Terrell was drowning and that you did not leave someone to drown, and the jury had not found this argument persuasive, and the judge had not found it mitigating, and Thomas Reed had not found it relevant, and now David was lying on a steel bunk in a concrete cell in upstate New York, eighteen years old, and the ceiling was twelve inches from his face, and the ceiling would be twelve inches from his face tomorrow and the day after and the day after that, five thousand four hundred and seventy-five times, and somewhere in the world there was a boy who had been eight years old in a swimming pool and was now fourteen, and David wondered whether that boy ever thought about the afternoon a stranger pulled him from the water, whether he remembered David's face, whether he knew that the hands that had held him above the surface were now folded on the chest of a man in a prison cell who could not sleep.

He did not know that the boy's name was Marcus Chen. He did not know that Marcus's grandmother had died five months after being resuscitated by a doctor who had heard a whisper she couldn't explain. He did not know that Marcus's mother told him stories about angels, or that Marcus carried those stories the way David carried the memory of the pool — not quite believing, not able to let go. He did not know that in twenty-two years he would open a shop and Marcus would walk in with a broken alternator and they would look at each other across a service counter and something would click, the slow tumblers of recognition turning, and Marcus would say, "The pool. Atlantic Avenue. You pulled me out." He did not know any of this.

He knew the ceiling. He knew the wool blanket that smelled like other men's sleep. He knew the sound of his cellmate turning pages below him and the distant sound of someone, several cells down, crying in the specific, strangled way of a man who has not yet learned to cry without sound.

In an office above a laundromat in Queens, in a room that smelled of fabric softener and old coffee, Gabriel sat at a desk that was too small for him and opened a file that had been flagged by the monitoring system. The file was thin — a name, an age, a sentencing record, a probability matrix that showed a young man balanced on a line between two futures, one of which ended in a cell and one of which ended in a classroom, and the distance between the two was fifteen years and a series of choices that had not yet been made. Gabriel read the file. He picked up a pen. He wrote a name on a list that already held forty-seven names, a list titled POTENTIAL MARGIN CASES - NORTHEAST REGION - Q2 2010. He put the pen down. He rubbed his eyes. He added a note: *Assign field angel post-release. Long-horizon case. Monitor only for now.*

He closed the file. He opened the next one. The laundromat below him churned and tumbled, the washers and dryers running their cycles through the night, cleaning and cleaning, and the sound came up through the floor like a heartbeat, steady and mechanical, the sound of something being made ready to be used again.

And in the cell, David lay still. The crying down the hall had stopped. His cellmate had turned off the light above the sink and the cell was dark except for the gray rectangle of the window, which held a piece of sky, a narrow strip of the same sky that covered everything — the prison and the forest and the mountains and the city where his mother was not sleeping and the pool where a boy had once gone under and the courtroom where a man had once stood and asked for the maximum and the office above the laundromat where his name had just been written on a list he would never see.

Fifteen years. The number pressed against him like the concrete ceiling, close and heavy and absolute. He closed his eyes. He folded his hands on his chest. He breathed.

He thought about the pool. He thought about the boy. He thought about the water closing over a small, dark head and the feeling of reaching in and pulling up and the weight of a life in his arms, eight years old and coughing and alive.

He held onto that. It was the only thing in the cell that belonged to him.
