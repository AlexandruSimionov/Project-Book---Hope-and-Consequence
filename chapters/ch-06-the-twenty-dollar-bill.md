# Chapter 6: The Twenty-Dollar Bill

**Baltimore, Maryland -- October 1991**

---

The cereal tasted like wet cardboard. Keisha sat at the kitchen table and ate it anyway because it was breakfast and you ate breakfast. That was a rule. Her mother had rules about everything -- brush your teeth, lock the door, eat breakfast, do your homework before the TV goes on. The rules kept going even when things stopped making sense, and Keisha liked that. The rules meant the day had a shape.

She was eating Cheerios with water because the milk had been gone since Tuesday.

The sound came from the front of the apartment. Not the front door -- the bedroom. Her parents' bedroom. Keisha stopped chewing. She heard drawers opening, the metal scrape of hangers across the closet rod, something heavy dropped on the bed. She knew what packing sounded like. Her mother packed for work every morning: uniform in the bag, name tag clipped on, shoes at the door.

This was different. This was her father packing, and her father didn't work mornings.

Keisha carried her bowl to the sink and climbed the stairs. The bedroom door was open and her father was standing over a duffel bag on the bed, pushing shirts into it. Not folding them. Pushing. He had on his good jacket, the brown one, and his boots. He didn't wear those boots to go to the store.

She stood in the doorway and watched him. He didn't see her for a few seconds, and in those seconds she saw his face the way you see a person's face when they don't know you're looking. He looked tired. Not angry-tired like when he and her mother argued about money through the wall at night. Just tired. Like he was done with something and the doneness had gotten into his bones.

He saw her. His hands stopped moving.

"Hey, baby girl."

"Where you going?"

He looked at the bag. He looked at Keisha. He zipped the bag shut.

"Daddy's got to go take care of some things."

Keisha knew what this meant. She was nine, not stupid. Trina Parker's father had left last spring with the same kind of bag. Trina said he was coming back. He didn't. Trina stopped talking about him by summer.

"When you coming back?"

Her father picked up the bag. He came over and put his hand on the top of her head the way he did when she was little. His hand was warm and heavy and she could smell his aftershave, the green bottle that sat on the shelf above the toilet.

"Soon," he said.

He went down the stairs. Keisha followed him to the front window in her bedroom and knelt on her bed with her face close to the glass. Her breath made a circle of fog and she wiped it away with her sleeve.

A car was parked at the curb, a red car she'd never seen before. Someone was in the driver's seat but she couldn't tell who through the windshield glare. Her father put the bag in the back seat. He stood there for a moment with his hand on the open door, and Keisha pressed her fingers against the window. He could look up right now and see her and maybe that would be enough, maybe he'd come back up the steps and put his shirts back in the drawers.

He got in the car. The car pulled away and went down Ashland Avenue and turned the corner and was gone.

Keisha stayed at the window until the shadow of the row house across the street reached the middle of the road. She wasn't crying. She didn't know why. It seemed like the kind of thing you should cry about, but nothing came. She just felt cold, the same cold as the apartment, starting somewhere behind her sternum and spreading out into her arms and legs until she felt like a house with the heat turned off.

She went downstairs and washed the bowl and put it back in the cabinet. She got her backpack and locked the door behind her, checking the knob twice the way her mother taught her.

---

Three days later, walking home from school, Keisha found the money.

It was October and the trees on her block had gone orange and brown. Leaves piled in the gutters and along the chain-link fences. The wind had a bite to it. Keisha's jacket was from last year and the sleeves didn't reach her wrists anymore, so she walked with her hands shoved in her pockets and her chin tucked down. She could hear a basketball game two blocks over -- the thump of the ball, somebody laughing, the chain net on the rec center hoop making that zipper sound when the ball went through clean.

She walked this route every day, knew every crack and buckle in the sidewalk. But today she was looking down because the wind was sharp, and she saw it.

A twenty-dollar bill, folded once, lying on the concrete right where it buckled near the Pattersons' front steps. Not crumpled up like somebody dropped it by accident. Just sitting there, folded in half, the face of Andrew Jackson looking up at the sky. Her mother had taught her the presidents on the money -- Washington on the one, Lincoln on the five, Jackson on the twenty, though her mother said Jackson wasn't anybody to admire.

Keisha stopped walking. She looked up and down the street. Nobody. Mr. Patterson's TV flickered blue through his front window. No one checking their pockets, no one looking for anything they'd lost.

She picked it up.

The bill was dry. It hadn't rained since Monday but the gutters were still damp, the leaves in the gutter wet. This bill was dry and clean, like it had just been set down. She unfolded it and held it flat between her palms. Twenty dollars. She had never held a twenty before. She'd held fives her mother gave her for the store, and once a ten at her aunt's wedding. But a twenty was different. A twenty was milk and bread and peanut butter and maybe cheese. A twenty was four days of food if you were careful.

She folded it back up and put it in her pocket and kept walking, her hand closed around it, the paper already getting warm from her skin.

She was thinking about the Food Lion two blocks past her apartment -- milk, bread, peanut butter, maybe eggs -- counting down from twenty in her head, when she heard someone crying.

Not loud crying. Small crying, the kind that leaks out when you're trying to hold it in, the kind Keisha heard through her bedroom wall some nights when her mother thought she was asleep.

A boy was sitting on the bottom step of a row house on the corner. Little -- maybe six. His knees were pulled up and his shoulders were shaking. He had on a coat that was too big, cuffs folded back twice, and his sneakers were torn. Not dirty-torn -- broken-torn. The sole of the left one had come away from the canvas and flapped open like a mouth, showing his sock underneath.

Keisha stopped. She didn't know this boy. He was too small for her school. A car went past on the cross street with the bass turned up loud enough to feel in her chest, and the boy didn't look up.

The crying was the quiet kind. The giving-up kind.

Keisha reached into her pocket and felt the twenty. She thought about the milk. She thought about standing at the kitchen table tomorrow morning eating Cheerios with water again. She thought about her mother coming home at eleven with her feet swollen and her eyes red, and what it would look like to open the refrigerator and see a gallon of milk in there.

She pulled the bill out and looked at it. Then she looked at the boy.

She didn't think about what she did next, not exactly. It wasn't a decision the way adults make decisions. It was more like water -- it finds the downhill path because that's the only path.

"Hey," she said.

The boy looked up. His face was wet and his nose was running. He wiped it on his sleeve. His hair was cut short and uneven, like somebody had done it at home.

"What's wrong?"

"My shoe broke." He sniffed and looked down at it. "My mama said she can't buy new shoes till she gets paid."

Keisha looked at the shoe. It was done. No amount of tape or glue was going to fix that sole. She knew because she'd tried with her own shoes last year, and duct tape lasted about two days before the sidewalk ate through it.

She thought about something her mother said once, when a woman at church asked for gas money and her mother gave her ten dollars even though they didn't have it to spare. Keisha had asked why. Her mother said, *Because I had it and she needed it.* Like having and needing were a kind of math that always came out the same way.

Keisha reached into her pocket. She had a five that she'd been holding since Monday, change from an errand. She pulled it out along with the twenty.

"Here," she said, and held out the five to the boy. "For shoes."

He looked at the money. He looked at her. "For real?"

"Take it before I change my mind."

He took it. He held it in both hands like it might fly away. "Thank you," he said, and his voice cracked on it.

"Go home," Keisha said. "Tell your mama about the shoe."

She turned and kept walking. She didn't look back because looking back would make it into something bigger than it was. It was just five dollars. She still had fifteen. Fifteen was enough.

---

The Food Lion smelled like floor cleaner and cold air. Keisha picked up a basket and walked the aisles the way her mother did, counting as she went. Milk, store brand, a dollar thirty-nine. Bread, eighty-nine cents. Peanut butter, the big jar, two nineteen. Eggs, a dollar fifty-nine. She stood in front of the cheese -- American singles, a dollar twenty-nine -- and picked up the package, put it down, picked it up again.

At the register, the total was seven dollars and sixty-two cents. She had seven forty-three. She'd miscounted somewhere. She stood there looking at the coins on the counter while the woman with the long nails waited.

"I'll put the cheese back," Keisha said.

The woman looked at her. Looked at the groceries. Looked at Keisha standing there alone with no parent in sight. She punched something into the register.

"Don't worry about it," she said. "Go on."

Keisha put the groceries in her backpack. The milk was heavy and cold against her spine. She walked home with the weight of it pulling at her shoulders and it felt good, the heaviness. Like carrying something that mattered.

---

Her mother came home at 11:14 p.m. Keisha was supposed to be asleep but she was lying in bed in the dark, waiting for the sounds that meant the day was over: key in the lock, door, the sigh her mother let out when she sat down to take off her shoes, the tap running because she always drank a glass of water first.

Tonight there was a new sound. A pause. A long pause where the refrigerator was.

Keisha got out of bed and went to the top of the stairs. She could see the edge of the kitchen from there, the yellow light from the ceiling fixture with one dead bulb. Her mother was standing in front of the open refrigerator with one shoe off and one shoe on. Looking at the milk. The eggs. The bread and peanut butter on the counter.

Her mother put her hand over her mouth.

Keisha came down the stairs. Her mother turned around and her eyes were wet.

"Keisha Marie Williams. Where did you get this?"

"I found money. On the sidewalk."

"How much?"

"Twenty dollars."

Her mother looked at the groceries. Looked at Keisha. "This isn't twenty dollars' worth of food."

"I gave some to a boy. His shoes were broken."

Her mother sat down in the kitchen chair. She sat there with one shoe on, her cleaning company polo still tucked into her khakis, her hair pulled back in the bun she wore for work, and she put her hands in her lap and cried.

Keisha didn't understand. She stood there in her nightgown and felt something she couldn't name, a kind of scared that wasn't about danger. Her mother was the person who fixed things. Her mother got up every morning and stood behind a register for eight hours and drove across town to clean offices until ten and came home and washed her uniform and did it again. Her mother didn't cry. Her mother said *we're fine* and *everything's going to work out.*

"Mama?"

Her mother wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. She reached out and pulled Keisha close, and Keisha's face pressed against the stiff polo that smelled like cleaning spray and the tired smell of her mother's skin at the end of a long day.

"I'm not sad, baby."

"Then why are you crying?"

Her mother was quiet for a long time. Keisha could feel her breathing, could feel the bones of her shoulder under the polo. Her mother had gotten thinner. When had her mother gotten thinner?

"Because you're good," her mother said. "That's why."

She held on. Keisha let her. The refrigerator hummed. The apartment was cold but her mother was warm, and for a moment the cold didn't matter.

---

Later, in bed, Keisha lay on her back and looked at the crack in the ceiling that looked like a river if you squinted. She thought about her father. Not about the leaving -- she wasn't ready to think about that straight on, the way you can't look straight at the sun. She thought about him sideways. The brown jacket. The sound the front door made when he closed it, which was soft, barely a click, as if he were trying not to wake someone up. The red car and the person inside she couldn't see.

She didn't hate him. She didn't have a word for what she felt. It was like a room she hadn't been in yet, a closed door inside her, and she knew eventually she'd have to open it but not tonight. Tonight she was tired and her mother was home and there was milk in the refrigerator and eggs for the morning.

She thought about the boy on the steps, wondered if five dollars was enough for shoes. She wondered where the twenty had come from. People dropped money sometimes. But it was strange, the way it was just sitting there on the dry concrete, clean and folded, like somebody had put it there on purpose. Like it was meant for her to find.

That was a dumb thought. Money didn't have intentions. It was just paper.

But she kept thinking about it -- the pull she'd felt toward the boy on the steps. That was the part she couldn't explain. It was like something outside of her had reached in and pointed, *there -- that one. Help that one.* Not a voice. Not a thought. Something quieter than both. A direction, like the way birds knew which way was south without anyone telling them.

She turned on her side and closed her eyes. The apartment was quiet except for the refrigerator and the pipes and her mother moving around in the bathroom -- toothbrush, water, the creak of the medicine cabinet. Normal sounds. Tomorrow there would be breakfast with milk, and Keisha would walk to school on the same cracked sidewalk, and her father would not be here, and that was how it was going to be now.

She thought: *Maybe he'll come back.*

She thought it the way you throw a penny in a fountain -- not because you believe it works, but because it costs almost nothing to hope.

He wouldn't come back. She would learn this slowly, over months, the knowledge settling into her like sediment in water, until it was just part of the ground she stood on. But that night she still had the penny. That night the wish was still in the air.

She fell asleep with her hand on her stomach, warm under the blankets, and outside the row houses of Ashland Avenue stood shoulder to shoulder in the dark the way they had for fifty years and would for fifty more. Somewhere a dog barked twice and stopped. The city breathed around her -- trash and cooking grease and October leaves and the mineral smell of old brick -- and Keisha Williams, age nine, slept in it the way you sleep in your own bed, which is to say completely, because whatever it was, it was hers.
