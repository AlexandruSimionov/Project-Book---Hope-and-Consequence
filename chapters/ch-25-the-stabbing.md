# Chapter 25: The Stabbing

**November 2024 — East Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York**

---

The Camry needed a new alternator. David Okonkwo knew this the way he knew most things about cars — by listening. The engine turned over with a hesitation, a half-second drag before it caught, and the dash lights flickered when it idled, and the battery gauge dipped toward the red at stoplights. He'd told the owner, a Dominican woman named Mrs. Alvarez who brought the car in every three months with a new complaint and the same twenty-dollar tip, that the alternator had maybe two weeks left. She'd said she'd think about it, which meant she'd drive it until it died in traffic and have it towed back and it would cost her twice as much. That was how it went. People delayed the fix they could afford until it became the fix they couldn't.

He'd been at the shop since seven. Emiliano's Auto, on Utica Avenue, a two-bay garage wedged between a laundromat and a Jamaican restaurant that filled the block with the smell of jerk seasoning by eleven every morning. The shop belonged to his cousin Emiliano, who had hired David six years ago — three weeks after David walked out of the gates at Jessup Correctional Institution with a bus ticket and a garbage bag of clothes and nothing else.

Emiliano had not asked questions. That was the thing about Emiliano — he had the intelligence to understand complicated situations and the wisdom not to discuss them. He'd handed David a set of coveralls, shown him the hydraulic lift, and said *you break it, you fix it*. The first week David had rebuilt a transmission. The second week Emiliano had raised his pay by two dollars an hour. They had not discussed it. There was nothing to discuss.

Six years. David was thirty-two. He had spent eight years in prison, which meant he had spent a quarter of his life inside, which was a fraction he did not calculate because calculating it would require looking at the division and the division would require looking at the remainder and the remainder was everything he had missed — his twenties, his mother's decline, the neighborhood's changes, the ordinary accumulation of a life that other thirty-two-year-olds had and that he was building from nothing, brick by brick, the way you build a house on a lot where another house used to stand.

He worked on the Camry until noon. He ate lunch at the Jamaican place — rice and peas and oxtail, the food heavy and good, the kind of food that sat in your stomach and said *you are here, you are fed, you are a body that needs things and is getting them*. He ate at the counter by the window and watched Utica Avenue through the glass, the traffic and the pedestrians and the particular rhythm of a Brooklyn block at midday, everyone going somewhere, the motion constant and directionless, like blood in a vein.

A kid came in for an oil change. Seventeen, maybe eighteen. He had the look — the new shoes, the phone, the posture of a boy who had recently been given something by people whose gifts came with invoices. David recognized the look because he had worn it at that age. He changed the oil and said nothing about the look. It was not his business. He had opinions about what the look meant and where it led, opinions informed by eight years of staring at a ceiling and understanding, with the glacial patience of a man who had nothing to do but think, exactly how he had ended up in that cell. But opinions were not the same as authority, and David did not have authority over anyone's life except his own, and his own was enough.

He finished at five. He washed his hands — the grease never came all the way off; it lived in the creases of his knuckles and under his nails, a permanent residue that marked him as someone who worked with his hands, which was fine, which was more than fine, which was the physical evidence that he was earning his place in the world through labor that asked nothing of him except competence and showed up every morning like a friend who didn't need to be impressed.

He locked the shop. Emiliano was in the Dominican Republic for two weeks, visiting his mother, and David had the keys, and the trust that the keys represented was a weight he carried carefully, the way you carry something fragile that was given to you by someone who did not have to give it.

He walked home. Fourteen blocks, the same route every day. Down Utica to Church, left on Church to East 48th, down 48th to his apartment, a one-bedroom above a barber shop, the rent paid on the first of every month, the key on a ring with the shop key and the mailbox key and nothing else. Three keys. Three doors. The architecture of a small, functional life.

The evening was cool. November in Brooklyn — the light going early, the sky turning the color of pewter, the streetlights coming on one by one like a conversation starting up. David walked with his hands in his jacket pockets, his shoulders loose, his gait unhurried. He did not hurry. Hurrying attracted attention, and attention was a resource he spent carefully, having learned in prison that the safest place in any room was the place no one was looking.

He passed the church on Church Avenue. He went there sometimes. Not every Sunday — not on any schedule. He was not religious. He did not believe in God with the conviction that belief seemed to require, the surrender to a system he could not verify. But he liked the building. He liked the quiet of it, the way the pews held silence — like a cup holds water. He liked the pastor, a woman named Reverend Clarke who had a handshake that could crack walnuts and who never asked him about his past, which was its own kind of sermon. He liked the community — the potlucks and the clothing drives and the way people in the church looked at him and saw a man, not a record.

He walked past the church. He walked past the bodega where he bought his coffee in the morning. He walked past the playground where, last summer, he had spent an afternoon helping a neighbor's kid fix a bike chain, the two of them crouched on the sidewalk with grease on their fingers, the kid holding the flashlight wrong and David not correcting him because the kid was trying and trying was the thing that mattered.

He was thinking about the alternator. Mrs. Alvarez's alternator, specifically — whether the aftermarket part he'd ordered would fit the 2011 Camry's bracket or whether he'd need to fabricate an adapter, and if he fabricated an adapter what gauge steel he'd need, and whether the welder at the shop two blocks over would let him use the MIG for twenty minutes if he brought a six-pack. This was the kind of thinking that occupied David's mind when he walked — practical, granular, the small engineering of a life built from parts.

The SUV was black. It pulled alongside him on East 48th, rolling slow, matching his pace. He saw it in his peripheral vision and his body registered it before his mind did — a tightening in the shoulders, a shift in his center of gravity, the ancient, pre-verbal recognition of a predator's approach.

He kept walking. Same pace. Same hands in pockets.

The window came down.

"D."

He knew the voice. Three syllables — one letter, the rising inflection of someone who expected a response — and the eight years of prison that separated him from the last time he'd heard it collapsed like a folding chair.

Terrence Walker. Terry. Who had been twenty when David was eighteen, who had been the one to hand David the gun on the night that ended David's first life, who had somehow avoided prosecution, who had — David learned later, in prison, through the network of information that flowed through the facility the way water flows through pipes — cooperated with the police in exchange for immunity, which meant that Terrence Walker was the reason David had gone to prison, which was a fact David carried in the same compartment where he kept other immovable things, things that could not be changed and therefore did not warrant the energy of anger.

"I don't go by D anymore," David said. He kept walking.

The SUV kept pace. The window was all the way down now. Terrence was in the passenger seat. The driver was someone David didn't recognize — younger, early twenties, the generic alertness of a soldier in someone else's operation. In the back seat, a third man. David could see the outline of him, a shape in the dark interior.

"Come on, man. Stop walking. Let's talk."

"I'm going home."

"Five minutes."

David stopped. Not because Terrence had asked him to, but because the SUV had reached the intersection and stopping was the only way to end the conversation before it followed him to his door. He turned and faced the vehicle. The streetlight was behind him. Terrence's face was lit by the dashboard glow — older, thicker, a scar on his left cheekbone that hadn't been there before.

"What do you want, Terry?"

"We need you for something."

"No."

Terrence smiled. The smile had a quality that David recognized from prison — the smile of a man who had heard the word *no* and considered it a preliminary offer.

"You haven't even heard what it is."

"Don't need to."

"It's clean. Quick money. In and out."

"No."

"D — David. Listen." Terrence leaned toward the window. "We looked out for your family while you were inside. Your mother. Your cousin. We made sure they were good."

"My mother died while I was inside. She died alone in a hospital, and nobody called me until three days after because the facility lost the message. Don't tell me you looked out for her."

Terrence's expression shifted. Not remorse — recalculation. The smile stayed, but the engine behind it changed gears.

"Alright. I hear you. But you still owe—"

"I don't owe you anything. I did my time. All eight years of it. That's the debt. It's paid."

The man in the back seat shifted. David heard leather creak. He kept his eyes on Terrence.

"Think about it," Terrence said. "We'll come back."

"Don't."

The window went up. The SUV pulled away, slow, rounding the corner with the deliberate pace of a vehicle that wanted to be seen leaving, that wanted the departure itself to be a message: *we know where you are.*

David stood on the sidewalk until the taillights disappeared. Then he went inside. He climbed the stairs to his apartment. He locked the door. He stood in the kitchen with his hands flat on the counter — the same gesture, he thought later, that a thousand people probably made when the ground shifted under them, hands down, pressure, the body's instinct to stabilize against a surface that wasn't moving.

He heated leftover rice. He ate it standing up. He washed the dish. He sat on the couch and turned on the television and watched nothing for an hour, the images moving on the screen without entering his mind, because his mind was occupied with a calculation he did not want to be making.

They would come back. He knew this the way he knew the Camry needed an alternator — by listening to the sound of the thing, the hesitation, the drag, the mechanical certainty that a system under stress would eventually fail. Terrence Walker did not accept *no*. Terrence Walker interpreted *no* as *not yet*, and *not yet* as a timeline to be managed, and the management would escalate, and the escalation had a trajectory that David could map from where he sat because he had seen it before, had been inside it before, had been the trajectory.

The options were binary and both were bad. Fight back — which meant violence, which meant police, which meant a Black man with a record in a confrontation with other Black men, which meant a system that would not look at his six years of clean living and see redemption but would look at his eight years of incarceration and see a pattern, and patterns were easier to sentence than people. Or run — which meant leaving the shop, the apartment, the barber, the church, the neighbor's kid with the bike, the fourteen-block walk, the three keys on the ring, the entire small architecture of a life he had built from nothing over six years.

He chose neither. He went to bed. He set the alarm for six. He got up and went to work.

---

They came back on Thursday. Same SUV. Different time — two in the afternoon, while David was under a Honda Accord replacing a CV joint, his back on the concrete floor, the car above him on the lift.

He heard the engine. He heard the doors open and close. He slid out from under the car and stood up and there were three of them in the bay, and Terrence was not smiling this time.

"We need an answer, D."

"You have an answer."

"Wrong answer."

"It's the only one I have."

The younger man, the driver, took a step forward. David didn't move. He was holding a wrench — a half-inch combination, nothing dramatic, just the tool that had been in his hand when they arrived. He did not raise it. He did not set it down.

"This is my cousin's shop," David said. "You need to leave."

Terrence looked around the bay. He looked at the tools, the lift, the Honda on the jack stands. He looked at David — the coveralls, the grease on his hands, the wrench.

"You really want this," Terrence said. It was not a question. It was a diagnosis. The tone carried something David hadn't expected — a kind of bafflement, the genuine confusion of a man who could not understand why someone would choose a garage over what he was offering.

"This is my life," David said. "You need to leave."

They left. The younger man's jaw was tight. The third man hadn't spoken. Terrence paused at the bay door and looked back.

"Last time, D. Think about what you're doing."

"I've thought about it every day since I went in. I'm done thinking."

The SUV pulled away. David set down the wrench and went back under the Honda. His hands were steady. His heart rate was not.

---

Friday evening. Walking home. Same route. Same fourteen blocks.

He was at the corner of Church and East 48th when they stepped out.

Not from the SUV. On foot. Three of them. Terrence was not there. These were the other two — the young driver and the man from the back seat, who was taller up close, with a face that had no expression on it at all, the face of a person performing a task.

They fell in on either side of him, matching his pace, the way the SUV had matched his pace two days ago, and David understood immediately that this was different. The SUV had been a conversation. This was a sentence.

"Keep walking," the tall one said.

They walked. Half a block. David's apartment was three hundred yards away. The streetlight on the corner was out — it had been out for a week; he'd reported it to 311 and received a confirmation number that meant nothing. The dark patch between the two functioning streetlights was sixty feet long, and they entered it, and inside the darkness the tall one grabbed David's arm and turned him against the wall of the laundromat, and the younger one stood three feet back, blocking the sidewalk, and the tall one's hand was inside his jacket.

The knife came out. Not a display — not a threat held at arm's length for dramatic effect. The tall one brought it close to David's ribs, the right side, below the last rib, and his other hand was on David's shoulder, pressing him against the brick, and his face was close enough that David could smell cigarettes and something mint.

"This is from Terry," the tall one said. "He said you'd understand."

David didn't move. Not from paralysis — from the specific, trained stillness of a man who had spent eight years learning that in moments of violence, the body's first instinct was wrong. The instinct said fight. The instinct said run. Eight years in a facility where both responses got you killed had taught him a third option: stay still, assess, wait for the opening.

There was no opening.

The knife went in.

It was not like the movies. It was not slow-motion. It was not accompanied by a dramatic score or a wide-angle shot of the street. It was fast and blunt and small — a short, hard push, the blade entering the tissue below his ribs on the right side, a sensation that was less like being cut and more like being punched by something very precise. His body registered the entry before the pain arrived, a strange sequence — the impact, a beat of nothing, and then the pain, which was not sharp but deep, a hot, spreading wrongness that started at the wound and radiated outward into his flank and his hip and his back.

The tall one pulled the blade out. The withdrawal was worse than the entry — a grinding, wet sensation that made David's vision narrow to a tunnel. The tall one stepped back. The younger one was already moving, walking away down the sidewalk with the unhurried gait of someone who had completed an errand.

David put his hand on the wall. The brick was cold and rough under his palm. He looked down. His jacket was dark — the blood was dark on dark, invisible — but he could feel it, the warmth spreading across his side, soaking through his shirt and into the waistband of his jeans. He pressed his hand against the wound and the hand came away wet.

He slid down the wall. His knees hit the sidewalk first, then his hip, then his shoulder, and he was lying on the concrete, on his side, and the concrete was cold and gritty against his cheek and the streetlight sixty feet away cast a circle of yellow that stopped ten feet short of where he lay.

He thought about the pool.

He thought about it the way you think about something that lives in the bottom of your mind, the place where the fundamental things are stored — your name, your mother's face, the feeling of water closing over a child's head and the feeling of your hand closing around a child's arm. He thought about Marcus. He didn't know the boy's name — he had never known the boy's name — but the face was there, the small face with the red chlorine eyes and the look of someone who had been pulled from one world into another.

He thought about how that had felt. Clean. The cleanest thing he had ever done. A straight line between seeing and doing, no calculation, no angle, no cost.

He pressed his hand harder against his side. The blood was warm. His fingers were slippery with it. The sky above him was dark, starless — Brooklyn did not have stars, not visible ones; the light pollution erased them the way noise erased silence — and the only light was the streetlight down the block, that distant yellow circle.

He wondered if this was how it ended. On concrete. In the dark. Because he wouldn't be who they wanted him to be.

A door opened somewhere. A voice — a woman's voice, pitched high, alarmed. "Oh my God. Oh my God, someone call—" The voice fractured and reformed. "Call 911! Somebody's been stabbed!"

David closed his eyes. The concrete was very cold. The warmth from his side was spreading, pooling under him, and the contrast between the cold of the ground and the warmth of the blood was the most vivid sensation he had ever experienced, the body's final insistence on being alive, on being a thing that had temperature and weight and a border between inside and outside that was now, inconveniently, breached.

He heard the siren before he lost consciousness. It started far away and came closer, the sound a rising wave, and David let it carry him the way the water had carried him, twenty years ago, when he'd jumped into the pool without thinking, the body moving before the mind could calculate, the same instinct, the same straight line.

---

He woke in the hospital. The room was white and blue and hummed with machines. His right side was a continent of pain — layered, textured, the wound itself a sharp central point surrounded by concentric rings of soreness that extended into his hip and his shoulder and his back. He breathed and the breathing was careful, shallow, the kind of breathing you do when the full expansion of your lungs would cross a border into something you can't handle.

A nurse was there. She was checking the IV in his left arm. She was young, maybe twenty-five, with braids pulled back and a face that combined professional efficiency with genuine warmth, the face of someone who had chosen this work and still, somehow, liked it.

"You're awake," she said. "Good. Don't move too much. The wound was deep — we had to repair some tissue in your oblique, and there was some liver involvement, but you're stable. You lost a lot of blood."

He tried to speak. His throat was dry. She gave him a cup with a straw and he drank, and the water was the best thing he had ever tasted, and then it was just water.

"How long," he said.

"You came in last night. It's Saturday morning. You've been under for about ten hours."

Saturday. He'd missed the shop opening. Emiliano's keys were in his jacket pocket. His jacket was — he didn't know where his jacket was. The keys. The shop.

"My jacket," he said.

"Your clothes are in a bag. The police want to talk to you when you're ready."

He closed his eyes. The police. Another conversation in a system that had never been kind to him, another set of questions from people who would look at him and see the record before they saw the wound.

"Later," he said.

She left. He lay in the bed and breathed his careful, shallow breaths and looked at the ceiling, which was white and featureless and held nothing — no cracks, no patterns, no rivers if you squinted. Just white. The white of a room designed to hold bodies while they healed, and the white was fine, the white was neutral, and David lay in it and felt the pain and let the pain tell him that he was alive, which was information he needed, which was the only information that mattered.

---

The recovery was supposed to take weeks. The doctor — an older man with gray at his temples and the tired competence of someone who saw stab wounds regularly enough to be unsurprised by them — told David that the blade had nicked the edge of his liver and torn the external oblique muscle and that the stitches numbered thirty-seven and that he should not lift anything heavier than a coffee cup for at least three weeks.

David stayed in the hospital for four days. He got up on day two. He walked the hallway on day three, pushing the IV stand, his right side screaming with each step, the stitches pulling, the pain a bright, specific thing that lived in his body and demanded to be acknowledged. He acknowledged it. He walked.

On day four Emiliano called. His cousin's voice through the phone was the voice of a man trying very hard not to say *I told you so* about a neighborhood that he had left for a reason.

"The shop's fine," Emiliano said. "I called Marco to cover."

"I'll be back Monday."

"You'll be back when the doctor says."

"Monday."

A pause. "David. I swear to God."

"Monday."

He went home on day five. Sunday. He walked up the stairs to his apartment, each step a negotiation with the wound, and he unlocked the door with hands that shook — not from weakness but from the specific tremor of a body recalibrating after trauma, the nervous system resetting, the muscles remembering what it felt like to be in a place that was safe. He stood in his kitchen. Everything was where he had left it — the dish in the rack, the towel on the hook, the three keys on the ring on the counter. The apartment smelled like itself. He stood there and breathed the smell and the breathing hurt and the hurt was proof.

---

Four days later, Thursday, he was at Henderson High School.

Emiliano's daughter, Marisol, was fourteen. Emiliano was still in the Dominican Republic and had asked David to pick her up after her after-school program. David had driven — slowly, carefully, the stitches protesting every bump and turn — and had arrived at three-fifteen and had parked in the lot and had gotten out and had walked toward the main entrance, his hand pressed against his right side under his jacket, the wound a low, constant heat that he had learned to work around the way you learn to work around any permanent condition.

The school was a brick building with a chain-link fence and a sign that said HENDERSON HIGH SCHOOL — HOME OF THE HAWKS. The front doors were propped open. Students were coming out in small groups, their voices filling the air the way children's voices filled air — completely, without reservation, the noise of people who had not yet learned to be quiet.

David was twenty feet from the entrance when he heard the sound.

It was not loud. That was the thing about it that he would remember afterward, when people asked him to describe it, when the reporters put microphones in his face and the questions came. It was not the thunderous, cinematic explosion that the movies gave you. It was a flat, hard crack — like a two-by-four breaking, like a car backfiring, like a sound that the mind rejected as what it was because accepting it would require accepting that the world had changed, that the air had changed, that the building in front of you was no longer a school but was now something else.

The second shot was louder. Or maybe it wasn't louder — maybe David was just closer, because his feet were moving, and he was moving toward the sound, and the twenty feet between him and the entrance was becoming fifteen, then ten, then five.

Students were running out. Screaming. The screaming was different from the noise they'd been making thirty seconds ago — it had an edge to it, a serration, the sound of people whose bodies understood before their minds did. They poured through the doors and David went against the current, upstream, his shoulder hitting a boy's backpack, a girl's elbow catching his wounded side and the pain flaring white and enormous and irrelevant.

He went through the doors.

The hallway was fluorescent-lit and empty. Lockers on both sides, gray metal, some hanging open. The floor was linoleum, scuffed, the same institutional flooring that David had walked on for eight years at Jessup, and the smell was the same too — industrial soap and bodies and the faint mineral tang of old building — and for one dislocating second he was in both places at once, the hallway at Henderson and the corridor at Jessup, the same light, the same floor, the same feeling of a contained space in which violence was happening.

A third shot. Down the hall. To the right. The sound was coming from inside a classroom, the door half-open, and David could see movement through the narrow window in the door — a shape, a figure, a person holding something.

He didn't decide.

That was the thing he would say later, and it was the truth, and people would not believe it because people needed decisions to be decisions, needed heroes to make choices, needed the narrative of courage to include a moment of deliberation in which the hero weighed the risks and chose the brave path. But David did not choose. His body moved. The same body that had jumped into the pool at twelve. The same body that had been lying on concrete three weeks ago with a knife wound leaking his life onto the sidewalk. The same body, operating from the same place — the basement, the place below calculation, the place where things were simple.

He went through the door.

The classroom was a biology lab. Posters of the periodic table and the human circulatory system on the walls. Lab tables with black tops. Chairs overturned. Students on the floor, under the tables, their faces white, their mouths open. Three people lying still, and the stillness was the wrong kind — not hiding, not ducking, but the stillness that comes after, the stillness of bodies that have stopped.

The shooter was a boy. Sixteen, maybe seventeen. He was standing near the teacher's desk with a handgun — a pistol, semiautomatic, David recognized the shape from eight years of proximity to weapons — and the boy's face was not the face of rage or madness. It was blank. Flat. The face of a person who had gone somewhere inside themselves where the world was not real, where the people on the floor were not people, where the gun in his hand was an extension of a logic that had no room in it for consequence.

David hit him low.

Not a tackle — there was no room for the running start that a tackle required. A lunge. David crossed the six feet between the door and the boy and drove his shoulder into the boy's midsection and the impact sent them both into the teacher's desk, which slid across the floor with a screech of metal on linoleum, and the gun went off — once, the sound enormous in the enclosed space, the round hitting the ceiling, plaster raining down — and David's hands found the boy's wrist and he squeezed and twisted and the gun came free and skittered across the floor and the boy was making a sound, a thin, keening sound, the sound of someone being pulled out of the place they had gone to, back into a world where things were real and bodies on the floor were people.

David's side tore open. He felt it go — the stitches giving way, one after another, a zipper opening, and the heat was immediate, the blood coming through the wound like water through a crack in a dam, and his vision went gray at the edges and his arms went weak but he held on. He held the boy's wrist with one hand and put his other arm across the boy's chest and pressed him down against the desk and the boy was thin and light and not fighting anymore, the fight gone out of him like air out of a balloon.

Someone was behind David. Hands on his shoulders. A voice saying something he couldn't hear because the ringing in his ears from the gunshot had replaced all other sound with a high, constant tone, a note sustained past the point of music into something mechanical.

He let go of the boy. Other hands took over — adult hands, a teacher or a security guard, pulling the boy away, and David slid sideways off the desk and onto the floor and the floor was cold and hard and his side was pouring blood and the gray at the edges of his vision was advancing inward like fog.

He looked up. The fluorescent light above him was bright and steady and it reminded him of nothing and everything — the pool, the water, the sun coming through the surface in shafts and splinters. He had been twelve. The water had been warm. The boy's arm had been thin in his grip. The same grip. The same hand. Twenty years apart and the same hand doing the same thing.

Three people dead. Others would survive. The boy with the gun would be taken away. The school would become a name on a list. The list was long and getting longer and none of the names on it should have been there and all of them were.

David lay on the floor and bled.

---

He didn't die.

The ambulance arrived in six minutes. The paramedics cut away his jacket and his shirt and found two wounds — the reopened stab wound, still sutured but torn, and a graze on his left arm from the round that had hit the ceiling, a furrow of missing skin that bled freely but was, in the triage hierarchy, an afterthought.

They stabilized him in the ambulance. He lost consciousness on the way to Kings County, came back in the ER, lost it again in the operating room. The surgeon who repaired the liver laceration and resutured the oblique told him afterward that he had lost enough blood to kill a person and that the fact that he had not died was a combination of physiology and stubbornness, and David accepted both explanations equally.

He was in the hospital for nine days. Longer than the first time. The wound was deeper the second time — not from the stab itself, which had happened weeks ago, but from the reopening, which had shredded tissue that was still healing, which had turned a clean laceration into a ragged tear. The liver involvement was worse. There was infection. There were antibiotics. There were nights when the pain medication didn't touch the pain and David lay in the bed and breathed his careful breaths and looked at the ceiling and let the white hold him.

Visitors came. Emiliano, back from the Dominican Republic, who sat in the plastic chair and said nothing for forty-five minutes and then said *you stupid, stupid man* and then said nothing else. Reverend Clarke, who brought a Bible she did not open and a container of soup she set on the tray table. The neighbor whose kid's bike David had fixed, who brought flowers and a card signed by the kid in careful, large letters: THANK YOU MR DAVID.

The reporters came too. The story had gone national — FORMER INMATE TACKLES SCHOOL SHOOTER, the headlines said, and the headlines were accurate in the way that headlines were accurate, which was not very, which was the reduction of a complicated thing to a sentence that fit on a screen. A photographer took his picture. A television camera was set up in the hallway. David declined the interview. He declined all the interviews. He had nothing to say that the cameras could use.

The nurse came in on the eighth day. Not the young one from the first time — a different nurse, older, with a face that had seen things and decided to be kind anyway. She checked his vitals. She adjusted the IV. She sat on the edge of the bed, which was not protocol, and looked at him.

"People are calling you a hero," she said.

David looked at her. His body was heavy with medication and fatigue and the specific weight of a man who had been stabbed and shot and reopened and sewn back together and was lying in a bed that was not his own, in a room that was not his own, in a life that kept asking him to do things he had not planned.

"I just moved," he said.

She looked at him. He looked back. The room was quiet except for the machines and the hallway sounds — footsteps, a cart rolling, a phone ringing at the nurses' station.

"That's what they all say," the nurse said. "The ones who actually do it. They say they didn't think. They say they just moved." She stood up. She adjusted the blanket over his legs. "Maybe that's what a hero is. Someone who moves before they think."

David didn't respond. She left. The room was quiet again.

He lay in the bed and looked at the ceiling and thought about the pool. About the water, warm and chlorinated, and the boy's face — the red eyes, the small hands gripping his arm. About Ray's voice in the Civic afterward: *Too soft. Gonna get you killed.*

Twenty years. Ray had been wrong about most things but he'd been close on that one. Too soft. Twice stabbed, once grazed, thirty-seven stitches the first time and God knew how many the second. A body that kept moving toward trouble because the basement of who he was didn't know how to move away.

He thought about the shooter. The boy's face. Flat and blank and then, when David hit him, suddenly not — suddenly a boy again, suddenly someone's child, the sound he'd made like a child's sound, thin and lost.

He thought about the three who had died. He had not saved them.
