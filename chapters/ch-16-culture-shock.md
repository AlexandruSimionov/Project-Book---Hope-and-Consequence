# Chapter 16: Culture Shock

**March 2018 -- Baltimore, Maryland**

---

The door weighed more than he expected.

David Okonkwo pushed through it with his shoulder and stepped into the parking lot and the air hit him like a wall of cold that was also somehow the most open thing he had ever felt. The sky was enormous. That was the first thought, absurd and immediate: the sky was too big. Eight years of fluorescent ceilings and concrete yards no wider than a basketball court, and now the sky went all the way to the horizon in every direction, pale and grey and limitless, and the sheer volume of it pressed against his chest like a hand.

He stood on the concrete pad outside the release processing center at the Maryland Correctional Training Center in Hagerstown, wearing khaki pants that didn't fit, a blue button-down shirt from the reentry clothing program that was too large in the shoulders and too short in the sleeves, and a pair of white sneakers that had been in a box since 2014 and smelled like the storage closet they'd come from. In his left hand he carried a clear plastic bag containing his belongings: a wallet with no usable ID, a letter from his mother, three photographs, a Bible with his name written inside the front cover in his grandmother's handwriting, and forty-seven dollars in cash. Gate money. The state of Maryland's parting gift for eight years of his life.

A car was supposed to be here. His cousin Terrell -- Terrell who ran the auto shop on Eutaw Street, Terrell who had written him four times a year for eight years, Terrell who had said on the phone last week *I'll be there when you walk out, cuz, don't worry about nothing* -- was supposed to be in this parking lot in his grey Civic with the engine running. The parking lot was half empty. No grey Civic. David stood on the concrete pad and looked at the sky and the cars and the empty spaces between them and felt something tighten at the base of his skull, a reflex so deep it had become architecture: the feeling of being in a place where the rules were unclear and the exits were not where you expected them to be.

A phone chirped somewhere. Not his phone -- he didn't have a phone. Someone else's, in the parking lot, a sound like a bird that had learned to speak in digital. David turned toward it and saw a woman sitting in a Honda, her face lit from below by a glowing screen she held in both hands, her thumbs moving across it in rapid, practiced strokes, typing or swiping or doing whatever people did with the rectangles now. She didn't look up. She was in her own world, a world that fit inside her palms, and David watched her the way you watch someone performing a skill you don't possess -- with attention that contained equal parts curiosity and exclusion.

When he'd gone in, people had flip phones. Small, hinged, satisfying to snap shut. His had been a Motorola Razr, silver, the coolest thing he'd owned at eighteen. Now the phones were flat and featureless and everyone held them like prayer books, bowed over them, faces washed in pale blue light.

The grey Civic pulled into the lot. Terrell parked crookedly and got out and walked toward David with the slightly rolling gait he'd had since high school, when a bad tackle had done something permanent to his left knee. He was thirty-one now, thicker through the chest than David remembered, with a beard that hadn't been there before and a Orioles cap that looked new.

"D," Terrell said. He stopped two feet away and looked at David. Then he stepped forward and grabbed him, pulled him in, and held him in the kind of embrace that men gave each other when they had used up all the other ways of saying what needed to be said. David's arms came up slowly. He hadn't been touched like this in years. The physical contact was startling -- the warmth of another body, the pressure of arms around his back, the smell of motor oil and Old Spice and the particular scent of someone who existed in the world freely, who moved through it without permission slips or count times or the ever-present surveillance of men in uniforms.

"You look good, man," Terrell said, stepping back, holding David by the shoulders. "You look skinny, but you look good."

"I am skinny."

"We're gonna fix that. Come on. Let's get out of here."

David got in the car. The seatbelt was wrong -- when had seatbelts changed? The strap sat differently across his chest, and the buckle was a different shape, and these were not things he should have noticed but he noticed them because everything was wrong or slightly wrong, every object in the world shifted a few degrees from where it had been when he'd last been allowed to touch it.

Terrell started the car. The dashboard lit up like a cockpit -- a screen in the center where the radio should have been, numbers and icons and a map that showed a blue arrow moving along a grey road.

"GPS," Terrell said, catching David's stare. "Tells you where to go. Like MapQuest but in the car."

"I know what GPS is."

"You know what it is. You don't know what it's like. Everybody's got one now. Nobody knows how to read a map anymore."

They pulled out of the parking lot and onto the access road and then the highway, and the speed was another thing that hit David physically -- the rush of cars on all sides, the velocity, the way the world blurred at seventy miles an hour after eight years of moving no faster than a walk. He gripped the door handle. He didn't mean to grip it. His hand just closed around it and held on, and Terrell saw this and said nothing, and the not-saying-anything was its own kind of kindness.

---

Baltimore came at him in pieces.

The skyline was the same but also not the same -- new buildings he didn't recognize, cranes on the waterfront, a stadium whose name had apparently changed since 2010. Terrell drove through the city on routes David had known by heart and the streets were right but the stores were wrong. The bodega on North Avenue where he'd bought Takis and Gatorade after school was a juice bar now. The handwritten sign that used to say COLD BEER HERE had been replaced by a chalkboard menu advertising something called a green detox smoothie for eight dollars. Eight dollars. For juice.

"Gentrification," Terrell said, as if reading the expression on David's face. "Been happening for a while now. Started around 2012, 2013. Developers bought up the blocks cheap after the recession. Fixed up the houses, jacked the rents. Half the old neighborhood's gone."

"Gone where?"

"Everywhere. Randallstown. Essex. Some went to PG County. Mrs. Henderson -- you remember Mrs. Henderson? Had the hair salon on the corner?"

"Yeah."

"She's in Dundalk now. Her shop's a dog grooming place."

David looked out the window. A young white couple walked a small dog past a building he remembered as a laundromat. The building was now a coffee shop with large windows and exposed brick and a line of people waiting at the counter, each one holding a phone. The dog wore a sweater.

They turned onto Eutaw Street. Terrell's shop was there, same as it had been, the sign still reading TERRELL'S AUTO in block letters over the bay doors, though the sign had been repainted and the lot had been paved since David had last seen it. It was the most familiar thing David had encountered since walking out of the facility, and the familiarity hit him harder than the strangeness had, a sudden vertigo of recognition, his body remembering a place his mind had kept at a distance for eight years.

"Nothing fancy," Terrell said, pulling into the lot. "Oil changes, brake pads, tire rotations. Keep your hands busy. I can pay you twelve an hour to start, cash till we get your paperwork sorted. You can crash at my place -- the couch is yours as long as you need it."

David looked at the shop. The bay doors were open and inside he could see a lift with a car on it, tool carts, the yellow-brown light of work lamps. The smell of the place reached him through the open car window: motor oil and brake dust and the sharp mineral scent of old concrete. It smelled like work. It smelled like a life that was small and specific and possible.

"Thank you," David said.

"Don't thank me. Just show up."

---

They ate lunch at the shop -- Terrell's wife had packed sandwiches, ham and cheese on white bread, with a bag of chips and two cans of Coke -- and David sat on an overturned bucket in the bay and ate and tried not to eat too fast. In Hagerstown the meals were timed. You had twenty minutes for lunch and you learned to eat the way you learned everything inside: efficiently, without enjoyment, the food a task rather than a pleasure. Now the sandwich was in his hands and nobody was counting the minutes and the ham was warm from sitting in the car and the Coke was cold and the carbonation bit his tongue and he had to remind himself to slow down, to taste it, to let the act of eating be something other than survival.

Terrell was under a Honda Accord on the lift, draining oil, when the black SUV pulled up.

David heard it before he saw it -- the bass from the stereo, deep and physical, the kind of sound that preceded a vehicle in certain neighborhoods the way a herald preceded a king. The SUV stopped at the curb outside the shop. Tinted windows. Chrome rims that caught the afternoon light. The engine stayed running.

The passenger door opened and a man got out. David recognized him the way you recognize a word in a language you haven't spoken in years: the meaning arriving a half-second after the sound. Jerome Kite. Jay. They'd been on the same block as teenagers, run the same streets, shared the same corners. Jay had been sixteen when David went in. He was twenty-four now. He wore a leather jacket that cost more than David's gate money and a gold chain that sat heavy against his chest and he moved with the loose, unhurried walk of someone who owned the ground he stood on, or believed he did, which amounted to the same thing.

"D." Jay spread his arms. "My man. Heard you was out."

David stood up from the bucket. "Jay."

"Look at you. All clean. Working at the shop." Jay looked around the bay with an expression that was not quite contempt but lived in its neighborhood -- a kind of amused assessment, the way someone might look at a child's drawing of a house. "Terrell's got you doing oil changes? That's cool. That's real cool."

"It's work."

"It's twelve an hour, D. I know what Terrell pays." Jay reached into his jacket and pulled out a roll of bills held together with a rubber band. He didn't count it. He just held it, let the weight and thickness of it communicate. "I can have you making this in a day. One day. No W-2, no time clock, no asking Terrell if you can go to the bathroom."

David looked at the money. He looked at Jay's jacket, Jay's chain, Jay's SUV with the engine running and the driver whose face he couldn't see through the tinted glass. He looked at all of it with the particular clarity of a man who had forty-seven dollars -- forty-three now, after the sandwiches he'd insisted on paying Terrell back for, though Terrell had refused -- and no phone and no ID and no references and no address that was his own and no history for the last eight years that a landlord or an employer or anyone at all would look at and think *yes, this person, give this person a chance.*

"I appreciate that," David said. "But I'm good."

"You're good." Jay tilted his head. The gold chain shifted on his chest. "You're good. Bro, you just did eight years. You got nothing. I'm offering you something."

"I know what you're offering."

Jay looked at him for a long moment. Then he put the money back in his jacket and shrugged, the way you shrug when someone declines an offer you know they'll reconsider.

"You change your mind, you know where to find me." He walked back to the SUV. The door closed. The bass resumed. The vehicle pulled away from the curb and rolled down Eutaw Street and turned the corner, and the sound of it faded and the street was quiet again except for the clank of Terrell working under the Accord and the distant sound of traffic on the highway.

David sat back down on the bucket. His hands were shaking. Not from fear -- from something more complicated than fear. From the proximity of a door he'd almost walked through, a gravity he'd felt pulling at him even as he said no, the honest recognition that the no had cost him something, that saying no to easy money when you had nothing was not virtue but arithmetic, and the numbers were not in his favor.

---

Terrell dropped him at the bus stop on his way home that evening. David needed to get across town to the reentry services office before it closed -- paperwork, always paperwork, the bureaucracy of freedom as dense and procedural as the bureaucracy of incarceration. He sat on the bench and waited for the number 27 and watched the city move around him.

Everything was screens. A woman at the bus stop scrolled through photographs on her phone, flicking upward with one finger, image after image after image, each one present for a fraction of a second before being replaced by the next. A teenager across the street held his phone horizontally and spoke into it like a walkie-talkie, then held it to his ear, then typed something, then held it horizontally again. An older man sat on the bench beside David and stared at his phone with the particular fixed attention of someone watching a moving image -- a video, David guessed, though the concept of watching television on a phone was one he understood intellectually without being able to feel as normal.

He had no phone. He had no screen. He sat on the bench with his plastic bag of belongings and his forty-three dollars and his blue button-down shirt that was too large in the shoulders, and he was the only person at the bus stop who was looking at the actual world -- the street, the cars, the pigeons on the sidewalk, the sky, which was beginning to darken at the edges, turning the grey of late afternoon into the deeper grey of early evening.

A woman sat down beside him.

She was perhaps fifty, perhaps older, with short grey hair and a winter coat that had been mended at the elbow with thread that didn't quite match. She carried a canvas bag that bulged with papers, and she sat down with the heavy, purposeful sigh of someone who had been on her feet all day. She looked tired in the way that David recognized -- not sleepy tired but ground-down tired, the tiredness of someone whose job required them to carry other people's problems.

She dug through her canvas bag and pulled out a flyer, pink paper, slightly crumpled. She looked at it for a moment, then looked at David. Not at his clothes, not at the plastic bag, not at the details that marked him as freshly released -- or if she looked at these things, she did it without the flinch, without the recalculation of distance that most people performed when they registered what he was. She just looked at him.

"You need this," she said, and held out the flyer.

David took it. The flyer was for a reentry nonprofit called Bridges -- job training, housing assistance, counseling, GED programs. An address on Pennsylvania Avenue. A phone number. Office hours.

He looked up. "I don't --"

"I know you don't know me." She smiled, and the smile was small and tired and real. "I work with people coming home. I can tell. You've got that look."

"What look?"

"Like the world got louder while you were away." She shifted the canvas bag on her lap. "That place on the flyer is solid. Good people. They'll help you get your ID, your paperwork, all of it. And if you need someone to talk to -- someone who understands the transition -- they've got that too."

David looked at the flyer. He looked at the woman. The bus was coming -- he could see it two blocks away, its headlights on in the gathering dark.

"I believe in you," she said.

Four words. Ordinary words, the kind that existed in greeting cards and motivational posters and the mouths of people who said them easily, automatically, the way you said *bless you* after a sneeze. But David had not heard them in eight years. He had not heard anything like them. In Hagerstown, the vocabulary of address was limited: his inmate number, his last name, the word *offender* on every form and every interaction, a word that replaced his name the way a label replaces a thing, until the label was all that was left and the thing underneath it had gone quiet.

*I believe in you.*

The bus pulled up. The woman stood, gathered her canvas bag, and got on. Through the window David saw her find a seat near the middle and settle into it with that heavy, purposeful exhaustion. She did not look back at him. The bus pulled away and she was gone.

<!-- AGENT:NOTE — Cassiel appears as the woman at the bus stop. Her appearance is nondescript, consistent with her field protocol of blending in. The intervention is minimal: a flyer and four words. From David's POV she is simply a tired social worker. The reader, knowing Cassiel from prior chapters, should recognize her. The "mended coat" and "canvas bag" echo her Chapter 1 characterization of wearing ordinary, slightly worn things. -->

David sat on the bench and held the flyer and the bus he needed came and went and he didn't get on it. He sat there. The street darkened. The screens around him brightened by contrast -- every phone, every car dashboard, every shop window -- until the city at night was a constellation of glowing rectangles, and David sat in the dark space between them with a pink flyer in one hand and forty-three dollars in his pocket and the echo of four words that had landed somewhere beneath his ribs and lodged there like a seed dropped into a crack in concrete.

He got on the next bus.

---

Terrell's apartment was a one-bedroom above a nail salon on Edmondson Avenue. The couch was brown corduroy, sagging in the middle, with a quilt folded over the arm and a pillow that smelled like laundry detergent. Terrell's wife, Nicole, had left a towel and a bar of soap on the bathroom sink and a plate of food in the microwave -- baked chicken, rice, collard greens -- with a Post-it note that said *Welcome home David.*

He ate the food standing at the kitchen counter. He ate it slowly this time, deliberately, tasting the garlic in the greens and the pepper on the chicken and the plain, ordinary miracle of a meal that someone had cooked for him specifically, with his name on a Post-it note, a meal that was not for Inmate 4471093 but for David.

He washed the plate and set it in the drying rack. He brushed his teeth with a toothbrush Terrell had bought him, still in its packaging. He changed into sweatpants and a T-shirt from the same clothing program that had given him the blue button-down. He lay down on the couch and pulled the quilt over himself and stared at the ceiling.

The first day of his life on the outside, and it was already over, and he was lying on a couch in the dark, and the silence was wrong.

That was the thing he hadn't expected. The silence. In Hagerstown, the noise was constant -- the intercom, the slamming of doors, the voices echoing off cinder block, the coughs and shouts and television blare of three hundred men packed into a space built for two hundred. You didn't sleep in silence inside. You slept in noise, through noise, surrounded by noise, and the noise became a kind of architecture, a structure you leaned against, a wall you pressed your back to. He had not slept in silence in eight years.

Now the apartment was quiet. The refrigerator hummed. A faucet dripped. Somewhere outside, a car passed, its headlights sweeping across the ceiling in a slow arc. That was all. The quiet filled the room like water, pressing against him from all sides, and David lay in it and felt the full weight of his freedom for the first time -- not the idea of it, which he'd carried for months, but the fact of it, physical and disorienting, the sensation of a man standing on solid ground after years at sea, his body still expecting the pitch and roll of a ship that was no longer there.

He thought about Jay's money. The roll of bills held with a rubber band, the casual display of abundance. He did the math without wanting to: twelve dollars an hour, forty hours a week, four hundred and eighty before taxes. Rent, food, bus fare, the phone he'd need to buy, the ID he'd need to replace. The math didn't work. The math never worked at twelve dollars an hour, not in a city where the rent on a studio was more than he'd make in a month. The math worked at Jay's numbers. That was the geometry of the trap -- it wasn't that the wrong path was appealing, it was that the right path was nearly impossible, and the distance between nearly impossible and actually impossible was where people fell.

He thought about the woman at the bus stop. *I believe in you.* He turned the words over the way he'd turned the flyer over, examining them from different angles, testing their weight. She didn't know him. She had no reason to believe in him. She'd looked at a man on a bench with a plastic bag and a pair of ill-fitting shoes and she'd said the thing that nobody said, and then she'd gotten on a bus and disappeared, and the fact of her -- her tired face, her mended coat, her canvas bag full of other people's problems -- sat inside him like something warm in a cold room.

He thought about the auto shop. First day tomorrow. Terrell would show him the lift, the tools, the oil pans, the procedure for rotating tires on a front-wheel-drive vehicle. He would learn it. He was good with his hands -- always had been, even as a kid, the kind of kid who took things apart to see how they worked and put them back together better than he'd found them. Eight years of prison maintenance work had refined the skill, though in ways that no employer wanted to hear about.

He thought about the minivan that had come into the shop that afternoon, just before closing. Terrell had been doing a brake inspection and David had been sweeping the bay and the minivan had pulled in and a woman had gotten out and opened the sliding door and a boy had climbed out of the backseat. The boy was maybe eight. He was wearing a backpack and holding a juice box and he had the look that children get in unfamiliar places -- wide-eyed, a little wary, pressed close to his mother's leg. David had stopped sweeping. The boy looked up at him, and David looked back, and for a moment the two of them existed in a small, still pocket of time.

The boy reminded David of another boy. Same age, same build, same wariness. A boy in a swimming pool in the Bronx, fourteen years ago, when David was twelve and the lifeguard was looking at her phone and the boy had gone under. David had been on the other side of the pool. He didn't know why he'd looked over. Something had pulled his attention, the way a sound pulls your head around even before you know what the sound is. He'd seen the boy's arms churning, the water closing over his head, and he'd been in the water before the thought had formed, swimming hard, reaching, pulling the boy up by his arms and hauling him to the surface.

The boy had coughed. Water had come out of him. He'd breathed.

David had never learned the boy's name. It had been chaos afterward -- the lifeguard screaming, parents running, someone wrapping the boy in a towel. David had climbed out of the pool and stood dripping on the concrete and no one had talked to him, not really, and after a while he'd picked up his towel and walked home.

He wondered, sometimes, what had happened to that kid. Whether he'd grown up. Whether he remembered.

The ceiling of Terrell's apartment was white and cracked in places, and a water stain in the corner looked like a map of somewhere. David stared at it and thought about twenty-eight more years of oil changes. Twenty-eight years -- that was how long it would take to reach the age where people stopped looking at him and seeing the eight years that were missing from his resume. Twenty-eight years of twelve dollars an hour and bus rides and a couch that wasn't his.

It didn't sound like freedom.

But the silence around him was not the silence of a cell. There was no lock on the door. He could stand up, walk outside, go anywhere. He could take a left or a right. He could buy a sandwich if he wanted to, at any hour, from any store. He could call someone, if he had a phone, and talk for as long as he wanted. These were small freedoms. They were the ones you didn't notice until they were taken away and given back, and in the giving back they were changed, weighted with a significance they'd never carried before.

Twenty-eight more years of oil changes.

It didn't sound like freedom. But it didn't sound like prison either. It sounded like something in between -- a margin, a narrow strip of ground between two cliffs, walkable if you were careful, if you didn't look down, if you kept your hands busy and your head level and your feet moving forward on a path that was too thin for running but wide enough, just wide enough, to walk.

David pulled the quilt up to his chin. The refrigerator hummed. The faucet dripped. Somewhere in Baltimore, Jay was counting money and the screens were glowing and the city was doing what cities do at night -- grinding on, indifferent to the men who slept inside it and the men who didn't. Somewhere in the dark of the apartment, the pink flyer from the woman at the bus stop lay on the kitchen counter where David had set it, its edges curling slightly in the heat from the baseboard, the phone number visible in the dim light from the street.

He would call it in the morning. He didn't know this yet. He knew only that he was tired, and that the couch was soft, and that the silence was terrible and vast and his.

He closed his eyes, and for the first time in eight years, no one told him when to sleep.
