# Chapter 28: The Failed Margin

**October 2024 — Westfield Academy, suburban Ohio**

---

Sariel had been working the case for four months, and for four months the case had been teaching him the cruelty of a system that was not broken but simply absent.

He sat in the faculty parking lot at seven-fifteen in the morning, in a car he did not own — a grey Nissan Sentra that belonged to the teaching persona he'd been maintaining since June, a substitute mathematics instructor named Daniel Avery who had excellent references and a quiet manner and a way of explaining quadratic equations that made students forget they were supposed to find math boring. Daniel Avery did not exist outside the Sentra and the classroom and the employee file in the front office, but his Social Security number would clear a background check and his teaching certificate had been processed through the state board with the undetectable efficiency of celestial bureaucracy at its best. Gabriel's office had issued the documents on a Thursday. Sariel had been in the building by Monday.

The parking lot was half full. Faculty arrived in waves — the early ones at six-forty-five, the on-time ones at seven-fifteen, the late ones at seven-twenty-nine, thirty seconds before the first bell. Sariel had mapped their patterns the way he mapped everything: methodically, without hurry, with the attention of someone who understood that patterns were the language in which systems spoke, and that if you could read the pattern you could sometimes find the margin where the pattern could be altered.

He had found the margin. He had not been able to reach it.

The girl's name did not matter, and Sariel did not use it — not out of disrespect but out of a discipline he had developed over ninety-six years of working Education and Youth cases, a discipline that kept the subject's identity separate from the subject's situation, because situations could be influenced and identities could not, and conflating the two led to the kind of attachment that made the work harder than it already was. She was sixteen. She was a junior. She sat in the third row of his second-period class and solved equations with a mechanical competence that suggested aptitude without interest, the way a person might tie their shoes — correctly, automatically, with their mind entirely elsewhere.

Her mind was elsewhere. Sariel had understood this from the first week. The elsewhere was a place he recognized from decades of working in schools, a place that adolescents retreated to when the world outside had become inhospitable — a sealed interior room where the self went to survive, and where the self, without ventilation, without light, without the intervention of someone who knew how to find the door, could suffocate.

The signs were textbook. Not dramatic — textbook. A grade point average that had dropped from 3.4 to 2.1 in eighteen months. Withdrawal from the two extracurricular activities she'd participated in — yearbook committee and the school's environmental club. A friend group that had contracted from four to one and then from one to none, the final friend having moved to Indiana over the summer, a departure that had removed the last human being who checked on her daily. Weight loss visible in the way her clothes fit, the sleeves of her sweatshirt hanging past her wrists. A pattern of tardiness that was not rebellion but exhaustion — the tardiness of a person for whom the act of getting to school required the expenditure of resources that were running out.

The signs were textbook because the textbooks had been written about precisely this kind of case. Any trained school counselor would have seen them. Any competent school psychologist would have flagged the grade drop, the social withdrawal, the physical changes. The interventions were not mysterious. They were documented, evidence-based, and available to any school that employed the personnel to implement them.

Westfield Academy did not employ the personnel.

The counselor position had been cut in 2022. Budget shortfall. The district had been operating with reduced state funding since 2019, when a series of municipal budget redirections — funds rerouted from public services to development incentives — had cascaded through the county's fiscal structure like a slow-moving crack through load-bearing concrete. The counselor, a woman named Patricia Huang, had served the school for eleven years. She had known every student by name. She had maintained an open-door policy that functioned as the school's informal triage system — the place where a student who was drowning could show up without an appointment and sit in a chair and say nothing, and Patricia would understand what the nothing meant, because she had spent eleven years learning to read the silences of adolescents.

Patricia Huang was gone. Her office had been converted into a storage room for athletic equipment. The door that had been open was now locked.

Sariel had tried to work around the absence. This was what angels did — they worked around absences. The entire practice of margin intervention was predicated on the understanding that the systems designed to catch people were imperfect, and that angels occupied the gaps the way mortar occupied the spaces between bricks, invisibly, structurally, holding the weight.

But this gap was not a gap. It was a void.

He had tried the teacher route first. Mrs. Delvecchio, English, twenty-two years at the school, the kind of teacher who noticed things — who noticed when a student stopped raising their hand, when a jacket got too big, when the quality of a silence changed from shy to sealed. Sariel had mentioned the girl to Mrs. Delvecchio in the faculty lounge, carefully, the way you mention something when you want it to register as the other person's observation rather than your own.

"Have you noticed anything with the girl in your third-period class? The one who sits by the window?"

Mrs. Delvecchio had looked at him with the expression of a person who was carrying too many things and had just been asked to pick up another. "Which girl by the window?"

She had thirty-four students in that class. She taught five classes. That was a hundred and seventy students, each of whom existed in Mrs. Delvecchio's consciousness as a name, a grade, and a set of behaviors that she tracked with the limited bandwidth of a woman who was also grading papers and writing lesson plans and attending meetings and completing the professional development hours that the district required and the standardized-test preparation materials that the state mandated and the incident reports that the administration requested whenever a student used a phone in class. Mrs. Delvecchio was not negligent. Mrs. Delvecchio was submerged.

"I'll keep an eye on her," Mrs. Delvecchio had said, and Sariel had watched the intention form and dissolve in the same breath, absorbed into the background noise of a workload that did not permit the luxury of attention.

He had tried the peer route next. There was a boy — a senior, Mateo, who worked in the library during lunch period and had the temperament of a natural counselor, the kid other kids gravitated toward because he listened without performing the listening. Sariel had arranged, through the kind of environmental adjustment that fell within protocol, for Mateo and the girl to be in the library at the same time, at adjacent tables, with a circumstance that might have generated conversation — a shared assignment, a dropped book, the kind of low-stakes coincidence that could, in the right conditions, become a connection.

Mateo had moved to Indiana in August. His father had been transferred. The family left on a Sunday. By Monday, the library was just a library again, and the girl sat at her table alone.

He had tried the counseling appointment. The district maintained a shared school psychologist who rotated among four schools, spending one day per week at each. Sariel had, through channels that were technically within protocol — a mention to the front office secretary, a concern raised at the staff meeting, the deliberate placement of the girl's name in proximity to the word *struggling* in a context that would prompt administrative action — arranged for an evaluation appointment.

The appointment was scheduled for November 3rd. The school psychologist was booked through October. Four schools. One psychologist. The math was simple and devastating: a child in crisis would wait six weeks because the system had allocated one professional to four buildings, the way a city might allocate one fire truck to four neighborhoods and call it coverage.

Sariel sat in the faculty parking lot at seven-fifteen in the morning and knew that the appointment on November 3rd would not matter.

He knew this the way he had known, on the Bosenbruecke in 1989, that the Wall was going to fall — not through divine revelation or angelic foresight but through the accumulated evidence of pattern, the way a seismologist knows an earthquake is coming not because they can predict the moment but because they can read the pressure in the fault. The pressure in this case had been building for two years. The fault line ran through a family that was fractured — a mother working two jobs, a father who had left, a sister who tried but was nineteen and working sixty hours a week at a grocery store and had her own drowning to manage. The fault line ran through a school that had been stripped of its ability to notice, to intervene, to hold. The fault line ran through a culture that had, through decades of accumulated indifference, decided that a counselor's salary was expendable and that the consequences of that decision were someone else's problem.

The consequences were sitting in the third row of Sariel's second-period class, solving quadratic equations with mechanical competence, her mind in the sealed room where the air was running out.

Sariel could feel her margin. It had been oscillating for weeks — not the rapid flutter of an acute crisis but the slow, grinding oscillation of a person approaching a decision the way a river approaches a falls, with increasing velocity and decreasing options. He could feel it the way Raphael had felt the margins multiplying at Bornholmer Strasse — as a physical sensation, a pressure in the sternum, a hum that would not quiet.

But this was not Berlin. In Berlin, the margins had converged toward an opening. Here, the margin was converging toward a closure — a door slamming rather than a gate swinging wide.

He had one more intervention. One thing he had been holding in reserve because it was the closest to the edge of protocol he could get without crossing it. The girl had a teacher — not Mrs. Delvecchio but another one, a younger teacher, Mr. Kean, who taught history and coached the track team and who had, in the first weeks of September, noticed the girl in the hallway and paused and asked if she was okay. The girl had said fine. Mr. Kean had accepted the answer the way people accept answers they know are false — with a flicker of doubt, with the intention to follow up, with the slow erosion of that intention under the pressure of a schedule that did not include time for hallway conversations that went deeper than fine.

Sariel had been working on Mr. Kean. Small nudges — a thought planted, an awareness sharpened, the kind of below-conscious influence that the Protocols authorized for non-margin humans in proximity to a margin case. He had been trying to get Mr. Kean to follow up. To pull the girl aside after class. To say the sentence that might crack the sealed room open: *I see you. You don't have to be fine.*

Mr. Kean had not followed up.

Not because he didn't care. Because he was coaching a meet on Thursday and grading midterms by Friday and his wife had just been diagnosed with gestational diabetes and his own capacity for attention, like Mrs. Delvecchio's, like the school psychologist's, like every human in the building, was a finite resource being drawn down by a system that demanded more than it provided.

Sariel sat in the parking lot and stared through the windshield at the school's front entrance — glass doors, a sign that read WESTFIELD ACADEMY — HOME OF THE WOLVES, a flagpole where the American flag hung limp in the October stillness. He had been in the building for four months. He had tried every intervention the Protocols permitted. He had been subtle. He had been invisible. He had been the mortar in the gaps.

The gaps were too wide. The mortar could not hold.

---

It happened on a Wednesday.

Sariel was in the faculty lounge when the first sound reached him — not a sound, technically, but the sudden cessation of sound, the way a room full of background noise becomes silent when the noise is interrupted by something the brain categorizes as wrong. The coffee maker gurgled. The microwave hummed. And then, from somewhere in the building, a sound that was not loud enough to be what it was, that could have been a locker slamming or a book dropped from a height, except that the sound repeated, and repeated, and the intervals between the repetitions were too regular for accident and too fast for anything but what they were.

The fire alarm went off three seconds later. Not because of fire. Because someone in the front office had pulled it, the way they'd been trained, as the protocol dictated — the protocol that existed because this was a thing that happened in schools now, a thing that had its own protocols and its own vocabulary and its own place in the architecture of American education, between fire drills and tornado drills and the drills that had no name other than the thing they rehearsed for.

Sariel was moving before the alarm finished its first cycle. Not toward the exits — toward the sound.

He did not reach it.

By the time he reached the B-wing corridor, the corridor was already a scene — a word that had a specific meaning in this context, a word that meant the place where the event had occurred and where the event's consequences were now visible in the form of people on the floor, and people running, and the sound of a voice — young, female — making a noise that was neither screaming nor crying but something between, the sound of a person who had crossed a threshold and was now on the other side of it and could not go back.

Three people were dead. Sariel knew this the way Cassiel knew Rosa Chen's heart had stopped — not through sight or sound but through the shift in the room's weight, the sudden absence of three presences that had been there a moment ago and were now not, like a chord losing notes and becoming something thinner, something that no longer resolves.

A man came through the far doors of the corridor at a run. He was limping. His shirt was dark with blood on the left side, the blood fresh enough to be wet, and he moved with the focused, asymmetric gait of a person whose body was damaged and whose mind had not yet registered the damage because the mind was occupied with something more urgent than pain.

David Okonkwo had been in the school's front parking lot, waiting for his cousin's kid. He had heard the sounds and he had gone in. He had not thought about it. He had not weighed options or calculated risks or consulted the part of the brain that maintains the body's interest in its own survival. He had heard the sounds and he had recognized them from the neighborhood where he'd grown up, where similar sounds had a different context but the same meaning, and he had gone in the way he had gone into a public pool at age twelve when he saw a smaller boy sinking — because the smaller boy was sinking and David was closer than anyone else.

He reached the girl in the corridor. She had stopped. The weapon was on the floor beside her. She had stopped because the thing she had come to do had been done, or because the doing of it had used up whatever fuel had brought her here, or because the sound she was making — the sound that was neither screaming nor crying — was the sound of a person arriving at the far side of an act and discovering that the far side was not what they had imagined, that the sealed room they had been suffocating in had not opened but had instead expanded to include the entire world, and the air was no better here.

David tackled her. Not violently — his body was already failing from the stab wounds he'd sustained three days earlier, wounds that had not fully closed, that had reopened when he started running, and the tackle was more of a collapse onto her, a covering, the way a person covers something they are trying to protect, though in this case the thing he was covering was the source of the harm and the protection was for everyone else. He held her on the floor and she did not resist, and the weapon lay two feet away, and the corridor was full of the fire alarm's shriek and the distant sound of sirens and the closer sound of David Okonkwo breathing in short, wet gasps as the blood from his reopened wounds spread across the linoleum.

Sariel stood at the end of the corridor and watched.

He did not intervene. There was nothing to intervene in. The margin had resolved. The margin had resolved in the direction he had spent four months trying to prevent, and the resolution was three people dead and a man bleeding on the floor and a girl who had stopped making sounds entirely and lay under David's weight with the stillness of someone who had used up every form of energy their body contained.

---

The afternoon was long and had the quality of a thing that was happening to someone else.

Sariel moved through it. He helped evacuate classrooms. He stood in the parking lot with the other teachers while the police established their perimeter and the ambulances arrived and the parents began appearing — first one, then five, then dozens, running from their cars with their phones in their hands and their faces holding the expression that Sariel had seen on the faces of parents in every era he had worked, from medieval plague to modern pandemic: the expression of a person who has been told that something has happened to their child and who does not yet know which kind of something it is.

He gave his statement to the police. He answered questions. He performed the functions of Daniel Avery, substitute mathematics instructor, a man who was shaken and cooperative and who had not witnessed the event directly but who could confirm that the fire alarm had activated at approximately ten-fourteen a.m. He performed these functions with the competence of someone who had been maintaining human identities for decades, whose body knew how to produce the appropriate physiological responses — the trembling hands, the slightly elevated voice, the thousand-yard focus that settled over people in the aftermath of violence.

Inside, he was somewhere else.

Inside, he was on the Bosenbruecke in 1989, sitting on the stone railing with his legs dangling over the water, watching the crowds stream across the bridge, and Raphael's arm was around his shoulders, and the air smelled like concrete dust and cheap beer and freedom, and he was saying: *If it can work here, it can work anywhere.*

*If one person's decision can bring a wall down, then no wall is permanent. No failure is final. No margin is too small to matter.*

He had believed this. He had believed it with the full, unqualified belief of a young angel who had just witnessed proof — tangible, visible, undeniable proof — that the work mattered. That subtlety worked. That one guard's decision could change the world.

Thirty-five years later, he stood in a school parking lot in Ohio and understood that he had been wrong.

Not about Berlin. Berlin had happened. The guard had opened the gate. The wall had fallen. The work had mattered. But Berlin was one data point, and the data set had grown, and the data now included this — this parking lot, these sirens, these parents running with their phones, this girl, this weapon, these three absences where three presences had been.

The work had not mattered. Not here. Not today. Not for the four months he had spent in this building, being subtle, being invisible, being the mortar in the gaps, while the gaps widened around him and the mortar crumbled and the girl in the third row solved equations with her mind in a sealed room and no one — not the teacher, not the peer, not the psychologist, not the angel disguised as a substitute — no one had reached her.

He had done everything right. Every intervention had been within protocol. Every nudge had been calibrated, every coincidence engineered within the permissible parameters of the Subtlety Protocols. He had been a model operator. And three people were dead.

*I can help one bullied kid*, he thought, standing in the parking lot as the October light began to thin, *but I cannot fix bullying. I can arrange one counseling appointment, but I cannot replace the counselor the district cut. I can nudge one teacher to notice, but I cannot give that teacher the time and the bandwidth to act on what they notice. I can work within the system, but the system has been hollowed out, and I am filling a house-shaped hole with handfuls of sand.*

The thought was not angry. Anger would have been simpler. Anger had a direction, a target, a kinetic energy that could be converted into action. What Sariel felt was something flatter than anger, something that lay beneath it the way bedrock lies beneath soil. Quiet devastation. The devastation of a person — an angel, a being who had committed ninety-six years to the premise that individual intervention could outweigh systemic failure — arriving at the conclusion that the premise was false.

Not universally false. Not false in Berlin, not false in the thousand smaller cases where a nudge had tipped a margin and a life had changed. But false *here*, in the specific, irreducible reality of a school in Ohio where a girl had died inside before she killed, and the dying had happened in plain sight, in a building full of adults who were trained to teach but not equipped to see, because the person who was equipped to see had been eliminated from the budget two years ago.

The specificity was the thing. It was always the specificity. Angels could think in systems, in patterns, in the grand architecture of interconnected margins. But the work happened in specifics — in this corridor, at this school, on this Wednesday. And the specific failure could not be absorbed into the pattern. It sat outside the pattern like a stone in a shoe, small and irreducible and impossible to ignore.

---

The school cleared by four. The parking lot emptied — first the ambulances, then the police cars, then the faculty vehicles, then the media vans that had arrived around noon and set up their satellite dishes and their cameras and their correspondents in pressed blazers who stood with the school in the background and spoke into microphones about tragedy and community and the word *unimaginable*, which was not true, because this was happening with a frequency that made it entirely imaginable, and the imagination of it was part of the horror.

By five, the parking lot held only the crime scene vehicles and the yellow tape that had been strung across the entrance in long, overlapping lines, the tape that would be there for days and that would accumulate, at its base, the flowers and the candles and the stuffed animals and the handwritten notes that constituted the American vocabulary of public grief — the same vocabulary deployed after every event of this kind, the same objects arranged in the same configurations, as if the grief itself had been standardized, mass-produced, available in bulk.

Sariel sat on the front steps of the school.

He had removed the lanyard that identified him as Daniel Avery. It lay on the step beside him, the plastic badge catching the last of the daylight. He sat with his forearms on his knees and his hands hanging between them and he looked at the parking lot — the tape, the distant vehicles, the flagpole where the flag had been lowered to half-staff by someone whose job it was to lower flags when this kind of thing happened.

The sun was going down. October in Ohio: the light went gold, then amber, then a thin, directionless grey, and then the grey deepened toward dark. Sariel watched it happen with the same focused, acquisitive attention he gave to everything — the light's quality, its angle, its slow retreat across the asphalt. He had always been an observer. Education and Youth angels were observers by temperament — they watched children grow, watched minds open, watched the slow miraculous process by which a human being acquired language and then used that language to build a self. Watching was the work. Watching was the gift.

Today the watching was a wound.

He thought about his report. Every intervention was documented. Every margin case generated a file — an initial assessment, progress notes, outcome classification. The categories were: Resolved Positive, Resolved Negative, Resolved Ambiguous, Unresolved, Abandoned. The form had checkboxes and text fields and a section at the bottom for narrative notes, where the angel could provide context that the checkboxes could not capture.

He did not know what to write.

*Resolved Negative* was the category. Three dead. The shooter alive. David Okonkwo alive. The margin had resolved. The outcome was determined. The checkboxes were clear.

But the checkboxes could not hold what had happened here. They could not hold the four months of work, the interventions attempted and failed, the teacher who was too overworked, the peer who moved away, the counselor who was cut, the psychologist who was six weeks out. The checkboxes could not hold the girl in the third row who solved equations with mechanical competence while her mind suffocated in a sealed room. The checkboxes could not hold the distance between what Sariel had been able to do and what needed to be done, the distance that was not a gap but a chasm, not a crack in the system but the system itself, operating exactly as it had been designed to operate — which was to say, with insufficient resources and insufficient attention and the implicit assumption that the gaps would be filled by someone, somehow, because they always had been.

They had not been filled. He had tried. He had failed.

Sariel sat on the steps and did not write the report. The crime scene tape fluttered in the evening wind, a small sound, the sound of plastic catching air, and the sound repeated at irregular intervals the way the sounds in the corridor had repeated, and Sariel heard both sounds at once — the tape and the memory of the tape and the sounds that had preceded the tape — and he did not move.

He thought about Raphael on the bridge. *Every margin matters equally.* He thought about the shoe, the white sneaker with the pink stripe, Stefan Eckel's daughter's shoe, and the way Raphael had held it up at the gate and asked a question that was not a question but a mirror, a surface in which a guard could see himself as a father instead of a soldier.

It had worked. In Berlin, it had worked.

Here, there was no shoe. There was no single object Sariel could hold up, no mirror he could angle, no coincidence he could engineer that would undo what the system had systematically undone over years of budget cuts and understaffing and the slow, bureaucratic erosion of the infrastructure that was supposed to catch children before they fell.

Individual intervention loses to systemic force. He understood this now. Not as a theory, not as a position in the factional debates that had been dividing the angelic community for years, but as a lived truth, a thing he had learned the way humans learned things — through loss.

He sat on the steps until the sun was gone. The parking lot lights came on, casting the kind of flat, shadowless illumination that erased depth and made everything look like a photograph of itself. The crime scene tape kept fluttering. A police cruiser sat at the entrance, its engine idling, its occupant a silhouette.

Sariel did not file a report that night. He did not return to the apartment that Daniel Avery rented on Oak Street, the apartment with the stacked textbooks and the lesson plans and the quiet evidence of a life that had been constructed entirely in service of reaching one student. He sat on the steps with the lanyard beside him and the dark around him and he thought about walls.

The one in Berlin had come down. He had watched it come down. He had believed, sitting on the bridge with Raphael's arm around his shoulders, that the falling of walls was the direction of history, that margins tipped toward openings, that the arc of angelic work bent toward the same thing the arc of the moral universe was supposed to bend toward, slowly, imperfectly, but bent.

The wall in the girl's mind had not come down. It had thickened. It had sealed. And then the girl had brought the sealed room with her to school, and the sealed room had expanded until it filled a corridor, and three people had been caught inside it, and no amount of subtlety, no amount of mortar in the gaps, no amount of protocol-compliant environmental adjustment had been sufficient to prevent it.

*The Protocols tell us to be subtle*, Sariel had said in Berlin, with the joy of a believer confirming his belief. *But what happened tonight—*

What happened tonight, in Ohio, thirty-five years later, was the answer the universe had been preparing.

What happened tonight was that subtlety was not enough.

Sariel sat on the steps of Westfield Academy as the last light drained from the sky. He was ninety-six years into his service. He had been the Angel of Education and Youth for ninety-six years, and in those years he had worked thousands of cases — the bullied child who found a friend, the failing student who found a teacher, the drop-out who found a reason — and the work had been good, had been meaningful, had been worth the ache in the bones and the weariness and the long, invisible labor of standing in hallways and whispering things that no one heard. The work had been worth it because it worked.

Until it didn't.

He picked up the lanyard. He looked at the name printed on the badge — DANIEL AVERY, SUBSTITUTE INSTRUCTOR — and he thought about the girl who had sat in Daniel Avery's class and solved equations while the room inside her sealed tighter, and he thought about the teacher who hadn't followed up and the counselor who'd been cut and the psychologist who was six weeks away and the friend who had moved to Indiana, and he thought about every intervention he had attempted and every intervention that had failed, not because the interventions were wrong but because the soil they were planted in had been salted.

He set the lanyard on the step. He stood. His knees protested — ninety-six years of service, the same ache Cassiel carried, the same ache every field angel carried, the body's honest accounting of the work's cost.

He walked to the parking lot. The crime scene tape brushed his arm as he passed it, a light, fluttering touch, the touch of a thing that was only plastic and only tape but that marked, in the vocabulary of this country, the place where something had been lost that could not be recovered.

He did not know, yet, what he would become. He did not know that this night — this parking lot, these steps, this tape — would be the fulcrum on which his ninety-six years pivoted. He did not know that within a year he would stand before a gathering of angels and say the words that would fracture the angelic community more deeply than any schism since the original Fall: *Individual margins are irrelevant against systemic collapse. We need to stop pretending that subtlety works against forces that operate at scale. We need to go overt.*

He did not know that two hundred angels would follow him. He did not know that the faction he founded — the Interventionists — would become the most controversial movement in celestial history, the angels who wanted to tear the curtain down and show themselves and fix the systems directly, by force if necessary, because the mortar-in-the-gaps approach had been tested against a hollowed-out school in Ohio and the mortar had not held.

He did not know any of this. He knew only that three people were dead. That a girl was in custody. That a man was in a hospital with reopened stab wounds and the exhaustion of someone who had saved lives and nearly lost his own in the same motion. That the sun had set over Westfield Academy, and that the flowers would come tomorrow, and that the flags would stay at half-staff for a week, and that the cycle — the shooting, the grief, the promises, the forgetting — was a pattern he had spent ninety-six years working within and could no longer accept.

He walked across the parking lot. He did not look back. The school receded behind him, its windows dark, its flagpole a thin line against the sky. The crime scene tape fluttered in the wind, catching the parking lot lights, a small, persistent sound in the October dark.

Sariel walked into the night, and the night received him the way it receives everyone — without judgment, without comfort, without the assurance that the morning would be different from the evening, or that the work would be different from the work, or that the margins would hold when the systems that supported them had been taken apart, bolt by bolt, dollar by dollar, counselor by counselor, until there was nothing left to hold.
